all right guys what is up hello VOD frogs welcome to day one of the lwig iron Manon real quick to go over the
rule set the way the iron mod works is is a little different from a Nuzlocke uh we are day one and so we
started with a trapinch who we've named after reviewer it's called Benny gon but as opposed to previous games
where you have to catch the first Pokemon in a route in this game you can only catch or kill one Pokemon per route
so I get to kind of pick my my my prey my Victim and in this
circumstance I do not want to kill this chincha I want to catch a
primape that is on this R love it stock Pokemon time it seems huh that's kind of
cool let's have some fun preferably not a level
three preferably not a level three and I'm going to use that so CH here's
the question when I pivot from my trap inch does that mean my traping dies or
do I put it in the
Box the person's not banned right
do I ban the
person small ANS here ah another l loock i see yeah
you're going to beat what I'm trying to do and then in seven years post the video when I've
become uh death okay guys the Pokemon is primate
if you'd like to be named after the prime ape all you have to do is type in chat to enter the
giveaway small ant if you type small ant in chat you
are entered the [Music] giveaway Now understand if you
die you will be permanently banned until I beat this game Sorry VA frogs back to
it so obviously every new Pokemon we catch uh we're naming after a viewer if that Pokemon dies they are permanently
banned now today we are starting with just one Pokemon I think this is going to be prove too tough for me so tomorrow
we're going to open up I'm going to allow myself two Pokemons the day after three Pokemons the day after four Pokemons the day after five Pokemon a
day after six Pokemons you get me so we're basically increasing our chance of winning the farther we go through this
challenge um having said that there is still a a a a how do you say
uh a time we're fighting against uh which is that while I'm sleeping at night my twitch chat is going to be
doing Twitch Plays Pokemon which is why I can't stream this on YouTube uh and if they beat Twitch Plays Pokemon with no
limiting rule sets before I beat my iron Manon uh I lose and I have to give 1 th000 Subs just Cory congratulations
what would you like to name the prime ape just Cory what would you like to
name your Prime ape if you could please let us all know you can just type the name in chat it can be called if you
don't give me a name I'm just going to use your name just Corey you want it to just be called Cory all right cool enough that's cool me Cory let's rock
it Corey Corey I love it boo no I think that's
fine I think that's fine and then mod you can turn off sub only chat part of the reason it's sub only is if Cory can
you type in chat for me would you mind would you mind typing in chat real quick
[Music]
your message will pop up if you are the picked Pokemon which is why we're doing
sub only cuz although it is very cute it would be quite
devastating uh if somebody were to I don't know say a [ __ ]
slur all right let's my
man so let's take a look at this primate it is a fighting
Pokemon with an impish nature prevents loss of accuracy it has
Safeguard hail volt tackle and water pulse
[Music] uh I don't know if we use this
[Music] guy do we stick with Corey
here do we chat Cory seems a little bit [Music]
ass Cory seems ass you have to use him is that how it
works I actually genuinely don't know if I have to use him I have to use him you are getting really good at online video
games thank you for letting us following along thanks thanks for the kind
[Music] words hey L is it safe to say you've
played these games before [ __ ] chill you have to I this might be so you
guys it's tough because there is a set ironon rule set if you do exclamation point bloodlock it should pop up and it
differs from the rule set that a lot of you guys know cuz here's the facts none of you have ever played these games
before everything that you are thinking of comes from you watching small an or
pointcrow okay let's just call a spade to [ __ ] Spade here 99.9% of you have no goddamn clue about
any of this [ __ ] ah
oh oh this is the catching
tutorial and Eric in and uh small used harder rule sets than I am using we're
not the same okay for example I am plat at League of Legends small ant is 6'1
Erica is in Japan we're not the
same uh I think we try to kill this no we shouldn't we don't have any good moves against it I was going to say we
kill it for experience but uh I think it's actually a bit too
dangerous you're you're diamond in League small if you're actually diamond in League I'm going to [ __ ] blow my
[ __ ] off smooth live on [ __ ] twitch you're
Diamond I've never seen you play the game one damn time what do you mean
you're Diamond I'm going to blow my [ __ ] off
smooth wait Chad I think we should catch the
bell sprout
why because Bellsprout has it's a three evolution Pokemon is it
not Bells Sprout weep and Bell Victory Bell primeape has no more Evolutions so
I'm not going to get any more value out of this primeape worm's also oh then we should
catch worle I think
we live [Music]
this and they called me [Music]
crazy all right it's it's worle
[Music] time uh all you have to do is type small
an is a liar in chat cuz he is there's no way he's Diamond there's no freaking
way he's diamond and then you are entered for the giveaway
[Music]
all right and the winner
is thank you very much for the the Prime nuko thank you Alex wander EJ Hardy uh
it's an OG EJ what you want your Pokemon's name to
[Music]
be I guess we should just you know what I'm just going to name it I'm I'm just going to name it after uh femore
Jr veto I'm just going to name it after um the person because I'm realizing
there's no point in trying to combine the Pokemon's name because the Pokemon's going to
evolve to something else
anyway veto's crazy I mean [ __ ] I don't want to keep track of
look it's how it be
[Music]
sometimes all right so now we have a worm pull I think this worm pole actually is pretty good it has a plus
speed lower defense nature it has flame body which I think means if you make
contact with it it will burn you it also has fire
punch poison sting sacred fire and
absorb pretty good move set now obviously its stats are very low but the good news is it evolves Next Level and what
it evolves into is totally random it could evolve into to a blaze
kin yeah so I think the way Evolutions are set is that they're not totally random I
believe I think it's set to evolve into a similar
typing but I don't know if it's based off moves or the Pokemon
itself I'm not going to kill the first Pokemon I see because I think a bell Sprout's Good
like I think a bell Sprout's Good to kill but I would rather wait until I see a higher level bell sprout in the area
for more XP no I will kill for XP I just I want a
higher level for more
XP uh-oh
now do I throw the ball or do I run again
okay I guess we are pivoting to
[Music] Swampert chat if you would
like to be named after swamper
[Music] all I got to do is type yo Majin Phil what is up man thank you
for the resub appreciate
[Music]
you all right let's roll it
[Music]
congratulations Z [Music]
FES ain't no way
[Music]
all right back to
it well unfortunately I could
save EJ Hardy with a potion but potions are so valuable
that we're going to have to kill [Music]
him which means
[Music] unfortunately is it EJ Hardy 46 is that
it oh
14 he knew what he signed up for see you guys in one
month okay good news news Swamper is actually really strong
like a phenomenally strong Pokemon so we're in a good position
we're in a good position right here oh I'm on the wrong scene we're in a genuinely good position
here [Music]
let's take a look real quick relax nature which means higher defense lower speed okay that's fine uh
what else what else about this guy uh Marvel scale UPS defense if suffering
okay so he's he's a defensive tank Dynamic punch that's kind of that's
horrible uh agility secret power ton okay the move set is bad the move set is
God
[Music]
awful but you know we'll we'll we'll make we'll make do we'll make
do oh yeah mods if you could be pretty good about sub only mode for the the picking but turning it off quickly after
my my apologies I genuinely couldn't tell we were sub
only dot thank you for the prime wait you're level nine what the
[ __ ]
there's no way
[Music]
I have a potion
[Music]
you don't need it what do you mean I don't need
it dude he has another Pokemon in the
[Music] back no items what the [ __ ] do you mean no items
CH there's a rule set read it Leaf
[Music]
blade smile I mean we 100% get rid of dynamic punch I think you get rid of
taunt isn't ton Loki
good this ain't VGC little bro got me on that comment I won't lie
you got me on that
one Heracross bug fighting type oh no is he setting up some fire
rock slide that's fine we don't care I'm getting parap flinched this is
ass bro
[Music] dude I get sometimes um like daily mail
notifications on my phone I should turn it off but I always find them so silly cuz I just got one that said Girl Scout
cookies cause autism 100% And I'm thinking I'm like damn I've
had a lot of Girl Scout cookies
that's not really a a time to say make sense isn't that the same route yeah this is what's called a trainer battle
so basically if somebody sees you they lock on to you and they start a battle with you I hope that makes sense anyway
I think being paralyzed is kind of good lowkey cuz paralyze is way better of a
status effect than burn or poison right
[Music] an a proc Marvel scale yeah I think we keep our
paralysis I don't think we heal I think lowkey this is smart I think being paralyzed is good for
[Music] me this is this is highkey smart as hell
12 normal flying type let's just go with secret power
what do that do attack rose that should kill you you're going
to be dead before you have the chance to hit [Music]
me do you only have meditate
Butterfree
uh-oh okay wait
[Music] easy genuinely so easy I don't know why you guys [ __ ]
O7 I'm not even stressed a little bit at all [Music]
lucky ass
[Music]
[Music]
oh
that's crazy that was [Music]
crazy that was crazy that was insane pain split with 2
Hp oh my God that was
crazy dude that is so funny uh I don't think we need acid armor I
think we have enough
defense dude that that was crazy I can't plays Pokemon democracy
mode or Anarchy mode right now it's Anarchy mode if it's if it proves to be
too hard for you we'll switch to democracy mode
if possible but right now it's Anarchy
[Music] mode please don't ban me I've subbed
less than a month
well you get banned if your Pokemon dies buy some Potions you're not allowed to in the rule set you can't buy potions
however I am going to buy some Pokeballs
go get all items Tim do we have the thing to show hidden items
[Music]
[Music]
oh [ __ ] yeah wait doesn't that just see that's not focus sash but it's like a half Focus
sash BL you miss an item we'll go
[Music]
back you can't hold items like that in battle what [ __ ] you mean no it's
not no held items chat I have the rule set you don't we read the rule set you
now to be clear you can't hold a lucky egg or a sacred Ash that's it end of the
list I don't know what this [ __ ] secret move I have is but this [ __ ]
paralyzes every time I love [Music]
it weather ball wouldn't you like to know weather boy
I mean maybe that's uh nah I feel like weather is weather ball good Chad it's sick is it better
than
agility I did it I did it
LOL Bro okay Tim what is up with the random ENC ERS being
legendary I literally went through the randomizer settings with Tim and I saw that there was no way I could have a
legendary all the wild Pokemon were set to no legendary all the starters were no legendary and I was like that's fine but
I didn't think I'd have to fight [Music]
him Aurora beam's decent
I have to go Dynamic punch and hope that it confuses and that he doesn't get a
move off with paralysis confusion and if I had just simply gone
secret power I would have killed him [Music]
hit yourself hit yourself [ __ ] [Applause]
yes yes yeah baby let's
[Music]
go there is a legendary Force at work to Ure sure that I don't lose early and
whatever it is I am a fan of
it [ __ ]
[Music]
[Music] I'm the
best I'm the [ __ ] best at this [ __ ] bro this is going to be 8 Hour stream
I'm going to be in home in time for
supper that's phenomenal man that's phenomenal that is absolutely
phenomenal this this goddamn Swamper is my favorite
Pokemon my luck has here's a sad thing like almost assuredly this run will fail
right like there's no way I first try an iron M with literally one Pokemon you know so it's sad to think like all this
luck is going to go to waste cuz I'm not going to beat it cuz surely I don't beat it my first try
[Music]
right since there's no YouTube stream can you enable twitch vods please are
twitch Bots not usually enabled
Tim someone keeps disabling them I thought it was you Tim I swear to God the moment the stream ends I've never
thought about the stream once I watch Like Dana Dan and bike on a pellaton it really doesn't go much much
deeper than
that I watched a YouTube short of Captain Sully the movie with Tom Hanks Landing the plane in the Hudson and then
I thought to myself I'd like to see the real video and then I watched the real video and it was really lame and then I
W I read like 20 Wikipedia articles about it
I'm a simple man it's
true oh that's not helpful at
all okay lock
in oh that's easy that is freaking easy br bro how about a paralysis how about
that
[ __ ] why didn't he get paral why didn't he get
[Music] paralyzed it's a different move now I don't know how that [ __ ] Works to be
honest not only did he get the power but thunder only had 70% accuracy that luck
was wild to me it's not luck luck I guess it's just freaking determination I
guess are you guys like trying to accuse me of having a dream save here any idea
what I should ask for next time this is the same route right chat what I should ask for who you
talking about yeah it's the same route right
[Music] yeah can I see your Pokemon you're
looking at him his name is swamper
[Music] chat should we watch Shopify Rebellion gold while we play right
[Music]
now you all just said no okay cool appreciate that appreciate the love
appreciate the love I do have them on a second monitor I've had them they're in game three of a valerant match against

I don't know if I could have done anything I mean we just ran we just dead
ass ran into a [ __ ] Espeon with Giga drain as a guy who is water ground
like it is what it is it is what it is that's
tough all right well chat you know what that means means it's time for a new
run oh it also means that zishes is banned

[Music]
[Music]
dude I should have named him woke I should have named him
woke okay we got a protein
all right guys you know the drill we get to randomly pick one of these three and
whatever one we pick we have to stick with as our Pokemon of choice I'm going to go left this
time okay let's um let's see what the other option are in case it's one of my
favorites okay
wow okay uh Lombre okay um who wants to be named
after Lombre in [Music]
chat for
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] can I say say some delusional
[ __ ] I dead ass thought I was going to beat the game on my first
[Music] run I'm not even [ __ ] with you I
genuinely thought
[Music]
I don't know why the Picker is taking this long by the way I I don't know what's going
on you stop it no I don't do I I don't think I do
[Music]
all right hold up press me again type me again
[Music]
did that
work Chad we crash it
CH we freaking crashed it okay new new code word
[Music]
hello [Music] Sher all right we learned our lesson it
is don't make the code word me
shopster all right welcome to the team shumster you are our Lombre now here's
the issue Sher you are probably going to die to the Altaria in this fight in about two seconds and we're going to
have to restart all of
this m make sure to turn sub only off
[Music] why are they always a higher level than me what is up with
that what is actually up with that is this
broken oh all trainers are 50% stronger rule
oh I think we have to go with Vol tackle I think it's the only
option we probably live
this good animation
recoil is
lethal oh my God GG
what wait critical
hit okay and guys really sad news here uh
wow that's that's tough that
is yep that
[Music] is you only ever had nine
comments I went to sub had to close the app when I reopened it's run too maybe I was the luck no way I literally subed 3
minutes ago I was sub for 8 minutes
total I'm going to get like a [ __ ] refund I'm going to get a refund within
like 10 minutes in my email sorry twitch user shopster said that he had a bad
time being streamed to your channel and he would like a refund all right shopster you get to
join the rest of the masses in dead world next run we go
[Music]
yo L will we ever see some of the RDC members on the yard or do you fear the
yard can't handle Mark's Mastery in crashing out would be I would want them to hang
out offline first
a pearl is such a bad item so if you guys haven't noticed
every time we open up a new game it's a totally new seed which means new starters new items uh new everything now
obviously we didn't get to see as much of what the newness was because well we uh instantly lost but but that's kind of
how these games
go all right I'm going to go left
again my God no
way oh my God salaman
that's [Music] crazy that is
crazy now we don't learn that many moves if you look at the move 5 9 17 2125 so
he hopefully he has a decent move set cuz we only learn like a handful of
moves before even level 20 this is illegal
move uh no wrong but thanks for checking in
appreciate you appreciate
you you just you just hate to see somebody come up
[Music]
[Music]
uh all right chat what do we name it uh let's take a look we're going to
make the message for this
one how about we make the message for one know you are not cheating
[Music]
actually this has got to be what a dictator feels like feels good feel
powerful strong
run
[Music]
it did it break again nope just took a while ye man do
he got the Wigglytuff buddy this is not going to go well for you
now he is level eight but like my stats MOG
[Music]
is B sweet kiss drill Peck and
snore okay we are all in on drill Peck
[Music]
[Music]
that would have really [ __ ] sucked I'll tell you what
all right so I'm almost positive our goal is to avoid ice types
and we are actually probably not going to catch another Pokemon we're just going to try to level up on every route
so my goal is to find like the weakest possible Pokemon and kill it as opposed to to
trying to find a Pokemon to cat to replace it Benny's illumination is Sparkles
stunning Sparkles I don't even know what the hell you're talking
about what's up SpongeBob I don't look like
SpongeBob you're good Tim you can play TTS though I know we're a bit backed up on
notice hey l what does chat have to do for you to get the newly dropped life-sized guard ofir for your room I
believe it will really bring that room together smile well I'll show you guys later but
I don't know if I'll be able to stick with it currently my bed is a giant
Snorlax it is giant but I don't know if I can have a good night's sleep on it
but I'll try I'm going to give it one night
what did you see Canada made a new job the fence are yeah yeah I I saw Canada's
trying to bring Zars back to the [Music]
West I don't know why I don't know why the name Zar was
chosen just what we need maybe maybe that's what we've been missing is Zars
Brian paralyze that woman you really aren't beating the
[Music] allegations I find it sexist to not admit that you want to paralyze someone
who wants to hurt
[Music] you all right we have our second encounter let's take a
[Music] look 500 Days of asking for this I need
something new as a part of my nighttime routine is what I meant maybe a league related challenge I'll think about
something smil I'm going to let you know the next person who tries to get me to do
something by asking me to do it for 500 days straight I will probably ignore because I don't want a swath of
new people met messaging me for for 500 days in a row flooding my
messages oh my God wait no no no
relax Evolutions are randomized it isn't a blaze kin it's not a blaze kin it's
not your friend we kill it for its experience and we move on
[Music]
do boxed Pokémon get banned during reset also you forgot your diglet cave
encounter right after the forest no the only people who get banned
are people who actually [Music]
die why is there no VOD Tim it's one thing to have to watch 7
ads it's another thing when it's the same exact Turbo Tax
a728 fake news that should be considered and un days love you
buddy an ad only works if you hear it 15 times damn it I keep getting [ __ ]
pearls okay we got Chikorita it double TTS it doesn't
double TTS it's just that if somebody happens to do a resub the resub TTS will
play at the same time as a donation TTS cuz they come from the they can happen at the same
time Twisted Spoon that helps with psychic type moves uh let you know what how about
before we dive in let's kill this level eight Chikorita I think it's going to be good experience
for us the that was really bad
experience that was [ __ ] wasteful you keep forgetting the free
item on the ground next to the old man
Dratini I'm trying to see like what good experience would be how do you
know that was shiny no guys that was just purple purple do wasn't equal shiny just
a heads
up Beldum is kind of
interesting I mean I guess I'll just kill you [ __ ]
[Music] Beldum was good XP I couldn't
tell all right I think we should be able to win this fight easy easy starting we're going to
go drill Peck he has really bad stats super
[Music] Fang we're going to gain a level so we'll gain a bit of HP
[Music] here I wouldn't lie to you guys I'm a little scared of losing this fight Teddy
Ura we're no longer
[Music] scared okay
[Applause] okay Yeet M do Yeet M do you can't put
pressure on me like that I get nervous trying to learn rockt ABS
[ __ ] lutely I'd love to learn excuse me I'd love to learn rockt uh rockt is a pretty bad move but it is ultimately a
much better move than um snore right snore is
horrible I can't believe snore exists as a move
all right we got to go back let's get our heels off dude I can't imagine so
right now I'm doing a a a lmon if you will we should probably actually Tim we
should change the title to lmon instead of iron Manon and then the command to lmon because people are getting confused
with L loock cuz this isn't a llck it's a lmon iron L I like it so anyway this is
an iron L I couldn't imagine doing the [ __ ] kaiso ultimate hard mode one
because you're not allowed to leave a a dungeon when you go in
one and you can't heal like it's it's so hard I watched the small ant video of
him doing the iron modon in preparation for this and to be honest he made it
look really easy like I didn't think it was that hard cuz he kind of just watched the video and he's like yeah so
yeah you just kind of kill him here and it worked out and so it's good I was like oh okay it's not even that
bad it's
hard keep it going oh whoa whoa whoa what are we
going to lose no we're good he's going to roll
low he'll roll low here
[Music]
just nothing I could have done
[Music]
[Music]
okay here's the thing as good as salamance is he doesn't level up very well which actually was
like he was leveling so much slower than um
Swamper and his move set was kind of mid and my eyes were a little red from
crying all night so there's a lot of reasons why that wasn't a winnable run and I think
this next run is going to go way better
pseudo legendary yeah see that's the thing people talk about pseudo legendary like it's good what if you tell your
significant other right now I pseudo cheated on you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you know what I need a Red Bull
I got a crack a bow what is up with your what do you mean what's up with my
shorts this is the Run
this is the
[Music] run you look like luuka donic in those shorts [ __ ] you man I don't look that
big come on
[Music]
shout out Archie Manning yo Archie if you're trying to link up let me know my fellow Red Bull brother two
athletes anyway we're going to go right here
who wants to be named after sunker anyone try to be named after
sunkern
[Music] just to be clear you are a level five
sunkern going in against a level eight probably Raichu you are going to get washed we're
going to be outsped outdamaged out defensed other rain any words you want to say like why did you
do this
[Music] it's cute all
right we'll call it rain I'm scared there's nothing to be
scared of this is like when kids say like oh I'm so nervous I didn't study for this test don't be nervous you're
going to do bad you no longer have to imagine what the worst case scenario is you're living
in it why are you
scared okay it's a shell gone this is
winnable okay hold up I got to uh I got to look at my moves cuz I actually don't know
them okay Splash that's tough
curse that's tough the move copies the last move used by the foe then disappears vital throw okay we're going
to go with vital throw I guess
[Music]
[Music]
okay is on to run number five on to run number five give it up I
was trying to run ads between runs so that I didn't have to run ads during the runs but unfortunately that run was too
short to run another ad so we're just going to skip that part and we're going
to ban other rain okay next one
wait if I open another ROM can I load a save from an from every ROM can I save basically
after this on every ROM and then just open that or do I have to go through
this if I do a new ROM because it's randomized it would only work with the
same randomized okay got it I just wanted to double check
[Music]
Thunderstone go middle this time here's what I'll do whoever it subs most recently and puts what direction they
want when I am picking I will just do that thank you very much Cai for the
five months of
prime do a poll we're resetting too much for polls [Music]
brother I would we're we're re we're losing like every 5 Seconds okay the pencil show resubbed and they put okay
skull resubbed and they put left so we're doing left just know skull you are the most recent sub so I'm doing what
you want which is manectric but the pencil show voted right and it would have been nit Arena you know what
actually I think manectric in this case is actually the correct pick I I actually think this is pretty decent
we're probably going to Pivot off of this eventually but but I actually think manectric is pretty powerful especially
if he goes Golduck here uh oh I'm not naming it after the
person who subed to be clear they just got to pick which side it's always going to be named after a random person here
not like a recent
donator keyword is
um what's a good keyword
[Music]
Wellington day one of asking you to speedrun Fallout day one of asking for a
job day one of asking for one penny day one of asking for
$10,000 day one of asking for a bro vers bro day one of asking for monetary
compensation and then they messaged me today and said Day 500 of asking for monetary
compensation which it's a bit of a
[Music] jump all right congratulations froggy
Bob I'll call it froggy in your [Music]
stead actually I can fit the whole
thing froggy Bob bad news they picked nit Arina good news you have volt
absorb it's actually pretty massive
you also have spark and protect this is actually all pretty
good we're going to we're going to run a protect off rip we're going to do a little uh just a little fishing let's
see what they [Music]
got sacred fire okay we're going to run a spark [Music]
that's a bit unlucky paralysis that's
good uh we're burned but for some reason it's not showing up that we're burned I think we just have to go for
another
spark okay we're winning I I think we should win if we don't get hit by a sacred fire right here cuz the sacred
fire did nine damage and the Burn's going to kill [Music]
us that's tough right is tough
user froggy Bob any final
words I can get some work done now their first ever message was to get picked for
the giveaway to be banned oh my
God wait they've been a lurker for genuinely 4 years they followed me in
September of 2021 before I went to YouTube that's great they're a career
lurker the dude this is this is like going to reinforce like if you're froggy Bob right now you're thinking to yourself like I knew I should have
[ __ ] chatted I knew I should have never [ __ ] chatted now I'm [ __ ]
banned I just never [ __ ] chat this wouldn't have [Music]
happened what is your name

that that's a really good item
all right what direction you want
Chad lowkey I think it's a middle angle
I'm with
you oh my God we picked good we picked good look at the move set
dragon breath poison Fang Blaze click kick that's a great move set no stab but
damn that's a great move set ground ground moves do scare us ground moves do scare us they don't have balloons in
this game that's what we need shop fire Rebellion lost
sagge sag freaking sagge
[Music]
uh all right guys giveaway it's an Agron the giveaway uh word is going to
[Music] be
um oh
[Music]
guys what do you think of my outfit
[Music]
oh it goes away if I click out I didn't know that happened thank you near COV for the two
months thank you Twilight Ranger for the 21 months quy thank you for the raw tier one welcome guys we had a thousand Subs
already today thank you everyone who subed I really do appreciate it we also have charcoal which increases our fire
damage by 20% and we have intimidate wait this is a really good Pokemon the the worst part about the
Pokemon actually honestly our nature is also pretty good considering that Agron never has good base speed to begin with
crowned Cowboy congratulations we have a nature that reduces our speed and increases our
special attack which is actually pretty good considering that most of our moves right now are special
moves yeah the biggest issu is are weakness to ground that that really is an
impediment we're tanky though though uh okay let's go with I guess
Cowboy crowned Cowboy is the winner Forex weaknesses are so
bad uh yeah but we can probably get pretty far before pivoting
right I here's what I've found is that the hardest part of a uh uh an iron
Manon is getting past like the first gym if you can do that you're in a
pretty decent
spot sunkern this is an easy kill we're going to just going to go with a blaze
kick wait what
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh I see we used all our r on the first
run how is it possible that I lose to a
[ __ ] sunkern bro that's so insane they hit their sing
I fall as for two turns and they happen to have brick break and then I even intimidate them
but they just go through that as
sunkern well um thank you Crown Cowboy for following for so long and we'll see
you on the other side [Music] that is so
horeshit that is [ __ ] insane I'm so tilted because I thought I picked so
good but it doesn't [ __ ] matter that I pick so good cuz I [ __ ] lose already all right right [ __ ] dude [ __ ]
ass this is actually freaking butt I'm not I'm not even GNA hold my words anymore this is

tilted what is my name going to
be Coots all right that's what worked if I keep my name as Coots I'll win who is
my enemy I mean I'm American so right now
it's Canada no they're a number one National threat that's why we're doing so much against
[Music] them hyper potion

seed didn't talk to Mom I'm going to talk to her on the way out right
I thought I talked to her before I leave
town all right we're going to go right right is right okay Zubat actually not that bad
that's better okay so we picked wrong for sure

poison powder RoR Leaf aerial Ace icy wind so good moves and we also have tm46 isn't that dig what is
46 is that another AI well we'll find out levitate on a flying type does nothing
lwig no because you keep your you're stupid you keep your ability when you
evolve and I can evolve into a different I can evolve into any poison type so I
could have levitate on consider like an ekins or Arbok
or you don't keep your ability okay uh we're going to do a

is kind of dog [ __ ] but a deep sea too okay all right so we get really [ __ ]
by by uh any grass moves that's our biggest fear all right let's uh do our
giveaway this is the run this is the Run
man okay how realistically possible is this challenge if you can only use one
on the entire game but you can't grind levels since you can only kill one mon perut then is there actual
hope I mean this has been done by many so yes it is doable it the question is
can I do it people have done this so it's it's it's hard but people have done it the
question is how long will it take me as a man Postman 1401 congratulations let's
give this name over to postman Postman what are your thoughts heading into this first battle you feeling good you wrote
07 in chat that's not a good sign okay
all right so one thing we should do to give you maximum luck is I mean it
doesn't really actually matter for this actually you know what I I should
give you the Deep SE too it's actually better than the soft
sand all right we're going with tangala who is grass type I think our best oh
he's grass
type somebody said there's no accuracy loss and you never miss in the lab so I'm going to go with thunder
[Music]
[Music] it's not looking good it is not looking

my rival's name is Epstein I'm against it can't believe you used all your luck on the first run run 1,000
soon left trust me that genuinely is one of the the
worst Pokemon in terms of how much it's weak to but it has decent stats
early that would have been infinitely better that would have been infinitely
better okay but in the context of this actually a grass flying is maybe the best of the
three like I should be able to beat the other two

like NBA players saying that's heat that's heat I've been I've been hearing NBA players say that and [ __ ]
so dude your move set except for Thunder kind of [ __ ] sucks we might catch the first Pokemon in the first round
outout oh we actually can't catch the first Pokemon cuz we don't have pokeballs yet so we're going to run from every battle keeping just log of who
we're running by and we're going to get Oak's parcel and uh when we deliver the

embarrassing cuz I L's did everything I could have this challenge is L's freaking

wing attack recycle Mega drain faint
[Music]
attack what do I go for here
I think I go for a wing attack
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
here's the thing I don't know if we can afford to get rid of dusome to be honest we kind of need his mod
Powers we might be too short staffed if we ban his ass I'm not even going to
lie we're just going to be a bit short staffed
there going be a bit short St as
[Music] all replace them does someone want a volunteer
tribute all right you have to if you genuinely want to volunteer his tribute
[Music]

[Music]
I'm boy your
name still here at this rate I don't think you're going to be able to make it
to the podcast next week
[Music]
okay I feel really good about this I feel really good about this
middle okay we beat that ground does beat that ground does
beat steel ultimately this might be the best Pokemon like
actually though
[Music]
no wait he might go Magikarp because Magikarp is water type and I'm ground
type so as long as he goes Magikarp there's a well I guess it can be any move
though [ __ ] it's tough to say I think it broke one second let me refresh it
[Music]
[Music] I eat your Cheerios all right Cheerios
congratulations Cheerios oh he went Magikarp okay all
right we have to genuinely so first off let's take your item it was tm21 let's take a look what tm21 is
[Music] mock Punch Yeah I think we learn it you
can't learn it okay
cool infatuates on contact that's kind of good oh extreme speed's really
good karate chop and drill Peck wa this is great this is
great pretty good move set to be honest you have 11 attack so we're being
negative [Music]
[Music] okay not bad
[Music] we just keep going extreme speed then it
doesn't matter that we're paralyzed as long as we don't get paralyzed one more one more hit kills we
live this for sure we live this for sure we live this absolutely we live this no chance we die here we're dead for sure
aren't we no wait if we don't get paralyzed we
win There's Hope
what is that
XP all right [Music]
whatever okay I'm I'm [ __ ] terrified of Pokemon in the wild like it is
genuinely scary as [ __ ] catch I don't have a Pokeball
[Music] bro oh
my no no please let me run
please should I stop and fight it I can fight
it I just just run yeah oh thank God thank God thank God thank God
[Applause]
hell
no less than three
[Music]
oh my god dude this is [ __ ] terrifying like this is insane so okay
what's my game plan do I try to catch I I definitely catch the tyion
like no questions asked for sure
right the issues that tylo's moves are pretty [ __ ] dog [ __ ]
that is
true let's hit it with the karate chop see if it brings out a better
move
uh-oh I don't think we C I think we kill it for experience I think it's
what the [ __ ] does that even mean yeah we we can't catch this bro the
XP from it going to be phenomenal we're going to get paid off this [ __ ] it's way better we'll we'll eventually pivot but
like dude unfortunately the tyion hit a
spiderweb I would have liked to catch the Agron but we got we got stuck in the battle
[Music] okay all right we have another
encounter shell Bell oh yeah let's let's uh let's rock a shell Bell that's actually really that's a pretty [ __ ]
amazing hold item [Music]
I agree we should try to Pivot let's take a look what's at Route
22 oh hello it's a bad idea though it's a
glass Cannon it's a glass Cannon
bro stats are randomized [ __ ] it we ball
[Music] we should probably
run [ __ ] it we ball
[Music]
useless
Bang [Music]
that's a good catch that's a great catch even a level eight as well that's [ __ ] great that is [ __ ]
great same height how tall was he 66 all right Chad if you'd like to be
the Alakazam all you have to do is type in chat
[Music]
dude it's crazy how much higher my viewership goes when I get past Professor Oaks there's like a 2,000
viewership bump when I'm just not resetting the game every 5
Seconds it makes [Music]
sense JY quick spear congratulations JY
you are our pivot Jin Qs Jin quick
[Music] spear now we are absolutely oh wow so
first off what we want to [Music]
do we want to take the item from Alakazam which is a macho brace we want
want to take the shell Bell we want to look at our Alakazam here Jolly nature which increases
attack uh and I no does that increase I'm blinking we have fire
blast Sonic Boom which is pretty good early on cross chop and
[Music] Endeavor okay it's a little scary
it's not the greatest move set for
sure thank you very much Cheerios guys W's for Cheerios who got us through the hardest part of the
[Music] game I think we give this
[Music] dude a shell Bell
a rough skin Alakazam is so funny no held
items what you we um we have a rule set
and no heal items isn't part of it
[Music]
all right this is technically a new route so we could pivot I don't think we go with a rapid Dash let's just see what
we have as options vile plumes
interesting corsola
I think we're going to try to kill the level eight vile plume with fire BL
nice good XP 210 a
[Music]
lot killing wild mons what's the rule set um you're allowed to catch or kill
one wild Pokemon per [Music]
area it's also just publicly available I think you're just a bit slow it's
[Music] okay
what Mak Saks your rival snd you'll be the
Run rude some people are I'm not being rude I just think they're probably slow
as a human do you know the most Googled thing the day of the American election
where's Joe Biden okay so you know look some people are just a bit is slow we don't have to pretend that doesn't exist
not everybody's smart and we'd be doubly as stupid to
pretend they don't walk among us among
us should I kill a Cadabra for
XP or is a Kabutops better for XP you think probably
Kabutops yo lad just wanted to say I am loving the production value we got going on here [ __ ] let's go oh oh
[ __ ] I'm going I'm just going to kill this guy cuz I am stuck in this battle and I don't want to die
all right I was good XP oh thank you for the Dono all right
we got to heal and then we have a bunch of trainers we have to fight shell Bell is [Music]
great hey evil muggle can you tell Elon Musk to stop coming into my Trade Secrets confidential files on how lvic
got his fake abs [Music]
huh what
now ground rock we go with cross chop
[Music]
poison flying hey guys roses Sama here sonic
boom I miss Chad already also lad I get married October 11th pull
up pull up to your wedding hey maybe uh-oh
nice we killed it with our rough skin rough skin alakazam's the
truth so I have horrible speed and my attack is actually pretty phenomenal
it's actually a very interesting Al Kazam build okay zatu psychic flying I think
our best bet hit him with a fire
blast gang gang gang gang gang gang G Dale four and thank you the five gifted
Dale I think we rip Sonic Boom cuz I don't think another fire blast kills what's up with the Fred
about to make a Minecraft Youtuber style apology video
outfit Sonic Boom might just be more powerful than fire blast at this level
wait what oh I
missed fake tears that reduces something special
[Music] defense okay we are a little bit low in
health this is a little scary
okay what the
[Music] [ __ ] I think we run a sonic boom to see how much health it has psychic's not
going to be too
bad our best bet is he he uses a stupid move and we win oh
wait I don't have any
potions
[ __ ] oh my god dude what dude the the I'm not happy with the amount of
legendaries it's too high can we say that it is obviously way too high I'm
running into legendaries every [ __ ] five five trainers it's
crazy I've run into a Groudon uh uh it's
insane godamn all right Jin you get

chat if we can get Snorlax that's so good
bro it's free points well it's free points till it's not that's the whole thing cuz we don't get out of the lab
like what 80% of the time but one time it's going to hit and then everyone's going the economy is going to crash
Snorlax got to be like a top five Pokemon you can like a maybe top 10 Pokemon you can get that's not like a
legendary pseudo legendary isn't it

Catch and Release that's true well if I catch no if I catch I
should just pivot to it its stats are better than butterf
freeze its moves are kind of ass though
maybe I can conversion to oh I'm getting so greedy I shouldn't
have done
this so [ __ ] bro so [ __ ] lame
that I can't [ __ ] catch his Snorlax anymore if you kill it no Snorlax I
don't think I'm allowed to catch it and then catch the Snorlax really that seems
wrong you can if you release it I mean all
right this sounds sounds like wrong to me but I'm not going to [ __ ] question it check the rules no I'll just trust
[Music] you it's only if you catch it on
accident whoops
oh God it's one of those snorlax's
[Music]
[Music]
Snorlax all right we do put it sub only just for the Pokemon picking name chat because your name will pop up on stream
[Music]
stream denino Deno congratulations Deno
[Music]
now this is 100% the winning run there's no forx weakness for a Snorlax we are
winning this [ __ ] I'm telling you we're winning this [ __ ]
let's take a look let's take a look at his move set so it's a level five Snorlax a
hearty nature prevents attack reduction hyper cutter that's kind of cool looking at its stats it has high attack High
defense okay enough special defense it's slow and it's got bad special attack but that's fine the move set we got belly
drum horn attack interesting uh Ember which is kind of
funny uh and renzy plant which I guess is like solar
beam uh so interesting to say the
least uh I think our goal right now should be well actually first off it does have an item
[Music] Let's uh let's see what that TM
is Swagger n Swagger's kind of
mid uh we're probably fine just with horn attack horn attack is a decent enough attack move let's go to Route 22
I don't know we're probably not going to Pivot we're just going to find a Pokemon to level up a bit off of I think beldums
decent enough I think we might just go off Beldum it is only a level one though or
excuse me um uh-oh good luck brother uh-oh
here's the issue your ability to run is based off your speed I don't have any
speed so I need to actually just kill the first thing I go up
against not a level three Beldum though
I think we just take it down for the
XP I'm killing it
ass okay all right we just got to get some points on
the board our special attack is horrible that's
true
okay let's uh let's get our item over here [Music]
poly toad
interesting Lantern Lantern should be good XP
no catch it if I catch it I have to Pivot so you guys are just misunderstanding I think the game
and I don't want to Pivot off
Snorlax Snorlax sucks the Snorlax is phenomenal I mean his moves aren't great but we're looking
at 31 HP 29 attack 20 defense at level
six zero speed that's good that's fine
you look you guys just don't understand Pokemon it's okay you just don't understand the game
it's I'm not mad at you for not getting it SE King oh God
now I'm not going to lie random battles [ __ ]
[Music] suck stop running just fight you can
only fight once per route so I I can't fight more than one
Pokemon which is actually a [ __ ] stupid [ __ ] rule I won't lie
I understand why it exists but man it is
[Music] cringe and there's no repels
[Music]
yet how do you level up against
rers do you think Cil is good
XP look what a smoke ball
does it allows you to escape from any wild battle yes
sir what a treat oh hell yeah that's
huge are smoke balls this [ __ ] nerd are smoke balls legal get the [ __ ] out
of here buddy okay do you mind [ __ ] off
kindly the only held items you can't have are lucky egg and sacred Ash that
is it we've talked about it plenty of times the rule set is available it's
linked if you're going to be one of those people at least read the rule set before [ __ ] complaining to me
I made it available well it just doesn't seem fair
well I don't give a [ __ ] what you think [ __ ] what do you want what do you
want from me play your own
game this was a game mode invented by a person and they deemed that it was legal
they thought about all the different held items and they thought smoke Ball's fine
all right we got to lock
in 100% horn attack that's going to
work horn attack again [Music]
Believe It or Not horn attack a third time horn attack
[Music] again grass move against flying wh why
are you
talking no shops it's no shops unless you buy Pokeballs Andor repels I've only bought Pokéballs in the shop why are you
talking there's too much idiocracy in my chat it's annoying
me I'm not used to you guys being this dumb I don't know if it's cuz poke uhoh
[Music]
imagine if you're faster imagine if you didn't [ __ ] talk before witnessing my dominance
[Music]
[ __ ] what the [ __ ] is [Music]
present a deli bird [Music]
move why is Butterfree on the screen I actually don't
know Tim [Music]
why is it a twitch only stream because um we're streaming for probably longer
than 12 hours which is the limit for YouTube
[Music] stream do new Grave Stone spawn when
Pokemon dies yeah ch how many hours do you think
it'll take [Music]
fully 8,000 now come on dude in 8,000 hours you could be the best three-point
shooter in your town 8,000 is ridiculous 8,000 is like 10 years worth
realistically I think I do this in about
100 15 that's my
guess 115 Dam no our obviously
hours have I killed a wild Pokemon on this
route all right let's fight a trainer we have to level up
somehow okay let's go with horn attack
[Music] lovely scary but we do what we do
best more attack
nice thank you mdala for the RO tier one
easy that's a great trainer that's
a why is the Butterfree still there UT's working on it
[Music]
isn't there a heal in the forest is there no I don't think this Forest I think you're thinking of a different gen
right it's like gen 7even Gen
4 beautifly horn
attack the Q patch has Nurse Joy same we might need this Q patch for
tomorrow not for the heels but just have Nurse Joy you feel [Music]
me master B thank you for the
pr Feebas what am I scared of I guess it's just fighting types really that's the
only
thing Thief dark type move Thief uh it's better than
Ember surely
right it's illegal no it's not the rule set specifically States you
can't use a move like Thief to like uh get items but you can still use the move
for for its damaging
[Music]
Powers oh God we should one shot there we
go all right run all the way
back oh this is cool shows all the
Pokemon yeah the smoke Ball's
[Music] nasty Butterfree hopping around uh we're
working on it what horns he taging with might be his rock hard
ears they look sharp
[Music] your speed's going to kill you look I
I'll be honest I would love to have a fast Pokemon that's strong and has a great typing I'm only allowed to look at
one Pokemon per area or sorry get one Pokemon per area this area there's
nothing better than the Snorlax so like you're just kind of being like dude it'd
be so much better cuz you play basketball if you were 6' 7 yeah but we're
not we're not we're just not so shut up what do you mean I don't know why you keep yapping about
it speed boost Beldum with detect speed boost Beldum with detect would evolve it
does not evolve in it's a random Evolution it loses ability when it evolves so you just have a random Steel
type with detect
all right auro that should be [Music]
free are pseudo legendaries allowed uh I
think we have it off so I don't know if it's allowed but we don't have it so I
think it I think it doesn't matter for us I'm pretty sure they are allowed in Iron Mons not like the Ultimate Iron
Manon or whatever but we won't be using [Music]
him I guess salamance sorry just maybe legendaries is the only thing we don't have then we don't have legendaries
turned on there wasn't like a pseudo legendary button in the [Music]
randomizer okay are there repels in here please tell me there are
I guess I don't even need them because I have Snorlax but it's fine there's no use in saving my money for anything
else uh all right we want to
eventually tackle Brock's gym but I would love a bit more
XP hidden item top left
[Music] I'll scour every [ __ ]
[Music] Bush
[Music]
W Dam they're gouging me at this Museum [Music]
guys it's a Snorlax W Auto
[Music]
the gym leader is going to be like what level 16 I mean let's just [ __ ] dive on in
eh [Music]
[Music]
oh
yikes [ __ ] this kind of cooks
us we're doing a little bit more
[Music] it's going to hit me a little harder well critical hit's going to make
it a lot harder well I don't know why I went Thief I read it in chat what a
mistake it is the Ember would have gone crazy
here oh I'm so mad at myself oh [Music]
oh that is so
unlucky he got a crit and we hit oursel twice and he got confusion off that's great for
him okay where is the route when you get to the first gym where do you go
[Music] but I can't go to the right every time I
go to the right it yells at me to go to the
[Music]
gym you have to beat the leader so to clarify I am not missing a route before the gym
there is no level up I could do in that situation they're wrong if they're saying
that there's a rival fight at vidiian Forest
[Music]
where oh the Victory Road area is that only after going through
vidiian [Music]
forests so that's the only thing I can level up
on what level does he have
all right back to the mines mods predictions do we get past the first
[Music]
fight dude that's so so [ __ ] unfortunate that's the only type that we really get boned by is a Steel
type that is a
bummer yeah I probably should have gotten rid of belly drum instead of
Ember but you know 50/50 hindsight look hypers cool to see more
lad [Music]
[Music]
loocks all that worko put in and it lasted a whole 2 minutes
[Music]
all right drown J thank you very much for the two months chat what direction
middle middle middle middle swub that's a really [ __ ] horrible pic
chat remade is actually pretty bad too tropus is easily the best here but maybe
he doesn't go tropus cuz we're oh he's
ground all right what do we do what do we do
[Music]
[Music]
what do that happen
[Music]
call Anthony off the ignore that what wait did it
break hello world wait does this not work
anymore oh there it is hello
[Music]
world all right roll it
[ __ ] let me roll it quicker maybe I just got to roll it really quick
I can't let names pile up uh uh Kiko
[Music]
kishiko all right oh he took the remr raade wait that's so good for
us oh my God he took the raray w
uh slam oh we got bullet seed all day oh [Music]
[ __ ] I could win this with five bullet seed hits no I couldn't I could not win this
with five Bol seed hits unfortunately now I could now I could
genuinely I need another
crit I need a crit oh my God they they you know what
kishiko put up a fight because that was five with a crit I don't think we have any speed moves here we just have to
hope remade makes a bad move yeah GG next mods ban kishiko sorry kishiko
[Music]
that's just the way it is things will never be the same
[Music]
did someone in chat say Swift has priority they don't know they don't know
that Swift is actually just a neutral move that actually never misses that's its Advantage it never
misses and it has like 60 base attack maybe 40 in this gen
that's crazy to not know that I'm dumb the issue isn't that you're dumb it's that you talk
too all right surely we go middle
again good Pokemon bug steel that beats out Togepi all day that
crushes zigzag goon that's a good [ __ ] pick that's an electric pick now
we are very weak to fire so I don't think we want to stick with this for a while while thank you uto I appreciate that
let's give a nickname let's give a
nickname uh I think we go here here here what is the
keyword um Prime smile
face damn that's a lot of people roll
it Gavin DNA Gavin welcome welcome Gavin you too
might one day be a headstone in the it that wasn't a threat on your life I don't know if that felt
like one I just met in the overlay he's going with Togepi that's really good for us to's got weak base
stats we have iron we have IR iron and we have q charm
as our ability which means we uh inflict we infatuate on contact high
special attack special defense speed bad defense Mega Punch interesting horn
attack I think in this situation we would go with Mega Punch Grudge
psycho boosts
okay yeah four times weak to fire is quite [Music]
scary so let's just rip a Mega Punch
off okay Sky attack I think we go for psycho boost
[Music]
and we win let's
go Razor Leaf that's way better than Grudge way better than
Grudge okay Gavin this is a so here's the real
Challenge from this point it is can we beat the first gym now I think Gavin has the
chops I genuinely think Gavin might have the chops to do
[Music] it Gavin loves talking on the
screen Gavin's having a great time
Gavin do this and then it's the Moy ass shaking Emoji
ryhorn we could have crush a ryhorn Jano you're doing great buddy at least in
this gen you can't use earthquake into a Pokémon holding a balloon six turns in a row lvic star what a random thing that
obviously I wouldn't do that was so random dude freak what's the new prediction does lwi
beat the first gym I feel like it should be 7030 no
yes potion lady I'm on my way to
her so we have increased special defense and lowered speed do our nature which is kind of bad but
whatever what could you not use the version of Iron
Man that smallest used saved time on resetting and helped with hidden items and helped with notes on what Pokémon
wear week two just a suggestion I don't know what the hell any of that meant
respectfully let's go kill the lick of tongue I
think are you allowed to skip trainers to save for later uh yeah why not
you should do some reading upon Iron Man and the tracker you're missing a lot of crucial easy to access info also the
Rival will always pick the mon to the left of the mon you select if you pick the far left it will pick far right oh I
didn't know that wait that's good Intel it doesn't really change anything at all oh yeah we
kill Alakazam I don't think we pivot Al actually maybe we no I don't think we
pivot Alakazam
right what am I doing what am I doing right now I'm like playing with a Tracker but I
don't I don't know
how all right I think we just kill Alakazam call it a day yeah
[Applause] okay that's good XP I think I think we
can go far with this guy right the thing is one fire move puts us
on our
ass the Rival fight I don't think we do it yet we're level seven [Music]
right I think it'd be a little silly to use it right now
Meowth absolutely not Meowth absolutely
not horsey absolutely not
there are four Pokemon here right explain the Luca trade in Pokemon
terms
uh Ash traded his Charizard to Giovani in exchange for giovan's
Persian the disrespect to ad I actually think Persian pretty decent
it's not ryhorn or Ryon is this it
here okay a sunkern I feel like it's not worth
killing the
Meowth is this the guy that starred in SpongeBob on Broadway Ariana Grande's boyfriend didn't know he
streamed do we catch or kill Machamp could be a decent swap not
as weak to fire but I mean here's the thing about Gavin's typing it's really good
against like everything with the exception of
fire Machamp is weak against like flying psychic
I think we kill it cuz it's also a pretty easy kill oh
we run wait a synthesis Machamp might be
worth catching lowkey
I think it might be better to be weak to more things than forx weak to one thing cuz Forex weak is just so bad
bro I I think we go I think we go with macham
no you're literally dead to an ember that's what I'm saying if somebody just happens to have any fire move I lose
like I just there's nothing to do I just lose but Machamp maybe I get hit by a
flying move maybe I get hit by a psychic move but I have
synthesis so I think we just do ourselves
the service of catching a
Machamp okay I'm not loving the move I just saw though wait hold up hold up hold up what moves do you have we back
to where I first subbed L loock time
baby you have beat up what's your fourth move hold up
what's the fourth [Music]
move I don't know if we catches
anymore I don't think we oh it's probably a poison move yeah you're right it's probably a poison move
do you think we catch or kill if it's poison sting it's really bad if it's sludge bomb it's great if
it's poison powder it's really bad if it's smog it's really
bad like about the only good move it could be
[Music]
yeah I think the odds are too bad cuz we're not we're not winning with just beat up I think we
kill Gavin you uh you get to see another day of fighting good XP on
that it's a bummer too because Machamp is like really great stat that slightly better than
uh
Caesar plus it had synthesis which is kind of sick but you
know hold up I think we do fight out here even though it's kind of [ __ ] because we get another level if I kill
someone here yeah I think it's worth being level
9 for the fight that's up coming just in case it's not like the biggest deal in
the world but Lemonade's huge 50 HP I
think rival fight we'll do it after verian Force I'm going to go through the force though heal I'm down 2 Hp I think
I'm good steel Rock I think our best bet
is Razor Leaf oh God
Jesus three turns of sleep four turns of
sleep uh do I go for psycho
boosts no right I just keep going Razor Leaf oh my
God I mean the good news is doing one HP oh okay okay the good news is we
can't be slept anymore cuz we're paralyzed I guess craon Razor Leaf
again all right an infatuated craon and we have Raaz Leaf we should win
this nice and it's a crit all right level
10 almost level 11 good ability it is pretty decent it's
not as good is there a paralyzed touch one cuz infatuation is just like
paralysis without the slow buff right so static is better
No in fact basically every other status effect touch is better right
[Music] love has a higher percent to stop them
from doing [ __ ] item I know he has iron I'm hesitating to use the iron on him though cuz if we pivot I don't want to
use the iron on him so I'm just letting him hold it for now I don't think there's something better for him to
hold item behind tree wait this one oh
yeah soft sand that helps with grab ground
moves it's kind of irrelevant for our
case all right how fast did your speed up there's like multiple there's like a 3X there's a 5x if I do them together I
don't know if it's multiplicative or what Rock Bug we just have to go ra wait yeah we
have to go Razor Leaf right
actually uh we can just go punch
right
nope oh
GG that's how it goes that is how it goes
eh that is why I wanted to switch to Machamp Gavin any final words
you are quite an active Pokemon
unfortunately this is the end of the road trans right
okay it makes me feel like a villain cuz you're saying it as if like
you're a martyr on your way to jail I've said Trends rights plenty of
times before Gavin just for the record you know not to take it away from Gavin love Gavin great guy been saying it for
years though you know CL me six years ago saying that so it's just no I'm not We're not gonna we're
not going to do this I know what you guys are going to start to do right now we're not going to do it we're not going to do it banned for saying trans rights
okay there it is there it [ __ ]
is okay
Citrus Berry that's really
[Music] good free Gavin he's not banned oh well
actually no he he is he'll be unbanned soon uh I think we go for the far right this time that is really
bad he'll have a voltor and the best one is a Magmar
okay um okay do you want to give a name to
Tyrogue yeah I think we're we're going to win this with our Citrus Berry though we should be fine we'll win it with the cidus berry so whoever picks the name
here don't don't fret you will be fine you'll be totally
safe um what should the message be
[Music] now say it with me chat lwig is not
transphobic all right
sadim wait sadim what I'm sorry I just happened to notice that you had had
a no prediction next to your name sadem what what was that
about what was that about well sish
dead I can explain cuz I'm just thinking maybe I don't give you the Citrus Berry that's what I was thinking sad maybe I
don't give this to you you know maybe I save it for next
run all right let's take a look what does sadim have thank you very much sir Munday for
the 33 months serious nature which is useless pickup which is somewhat useful
I guess skull bash which is kind of [ __ ] cosmic
power petal dance [Music]
okay huh the moves are decent it's not that good in this fight
unfortunately I think our best bet right
now is faint
attack well actually what typing am I fighting yeah they we just go faint
attack skull bash isn't that valuable right pedal dance
maybe attack and special attack are almost equal
[Music]
[Music]
there's not really a great move to use
here I I think it's just straight up
a faint
[Music] attack bless you thank you whoa how' you
know all right let's go pedal dance
yeah no this is
cooked so it seems like while I'm doing oh [ __ ] to be honest that was winable if
you didn't hit yourself in confusion
[Music] bye [Music]
sadim give it up for run number 20
[Music]
[Music]
did you say bye forever when you left T's stream to drunk Drive because you thought it would be a cool clip if you
died I sorry first off I did not drunk Drive second off no that did not Crush
my mind even a little bit cuz I wasn't drunk driving third it wouldn't be cool it
would not be cool if I [ __ ] died in a horrific drunk driving accident and then
people pulled up the clip of me going no I'm not drunk and proceeding to drive
drunk and then saying I would be say bye
forever if I died for a more noble cause that would be cool right if I said bue forever and then I died
fighting like aliens who invaded Earth that would be
cool left fine bad [ __ ] call chat
bad [ __ ] call chat oh wait actually good call bad call
chat [ __ ] we could have had Brum okay the good news is we have
tentacle and he has combustion so we should win our fight move sets good
sludge very good Thunder Punch sleep talk can be replaced super power so the
move set is good no water moves that's fine we don't need water moves right now we should win
with sludge and we're going to name it after a chatter the name should be
someone who types in
um oh my God look at my gross attack wait so poison is a physical
right poison is physical yeah wow yeah so my attack and speed are this actually
a pretty good tentacle All Things Considered congratulations to the winner of our
giveaway and the oh banana bread banana bread why do I see you're
also a doubter
banana I'm going to write banana bread like this so
ultimately this is a pretty good Pokemon I have it's kind of funny we had the iconic firat grass
starters all right I think our play is absolutely dropping a sludge okay GG he
has earthquake and I wish you guys pick a muskin okay wow that is sick that is
sick that is [ __ ] sick wow okay damn
if I started with a combustion with [ __ ] earthquake I'd be overjoyed okay that is gross I would
have had combus into Brum too okay don't think about it don't think about it combustion into Brum with earthquake
don't think about it doesn't matter we're moving on ban that [ __ ] sorry ban banana
bread all right you're killing me you guys picked it you guys picked it and
I'm killing you
[Music]
you threw I didn't even get to make a move we're going to be here while run a
prediction I I hey I guarantee you right now I win this one straight up I'm going I can tell right now I'm going middle
it's going to be a Gloom left is going to be some [ __ ] ass Rock
Pokemon I'm going to [Music]
win I'm cool with it I'll take it I'll take
it yeah I'll take it it's a legendary no it's a mythical
so you should feel a little embarrassed they're different they're different welcome to
Pokémon it's a it's a mythical not a legendary and also its base stats are less than 600 which is usually the
amount where you cut off so so actually no
[Music]
it's mystical not
mythical look how many people are saying I'm [Music]
right all right congratul runchy
milk this is cheating look to be honest I didn't even think we could have this happen I don't
know how this happened I thought we turned legendaries off let's take a look
[Music]
okay okay if you're randomly selected starters a Bann Pokemon you must select
another starter I didn't know about this Clause if your Pokemon evolves into a legendary that's fine to keep using so I
didn't know I didn't I genuinely didn't know we're going to play out the trainer battle and then I'll just swap on the
first available
opportunity see dumb [ __ ] peran you're [ __ ] rude eat [ __ ] die find a hole
live in
[Music] it says you I'm not rude I'm really
sweet [Music]
Alex don't call me bro you're older than me man you're older than me bro refund
uh should we refund
[Music] to be
honest I don't want to give it to him
but I think it's all right to
refund I think it's actually all right to refund
because my argument against refunding would be that I would have had the option of what Pokemon to pick but
frankly my options were whatever the [ __ ] that Pokemon with imprison just was
or the other Pokemon going into Raichu and I think I would have lost both so I would say doubters although
you won or sorry Believers although you won you kind of you kind of we kind of dodged a bullet honestly we low-key dodg
bull it like if I had followed the rules if I had known the rules and followed them correctly we probably would have lost that one keeping it 100 we probably
would have lost that [ __ ] on the ls Alex how's Minecraft
going Alex one of the worst Minecraft players I've ever seen I dead ass watch his stream and he built like this glass
roof and it was like one block off where he wanted it to be he put like 30 pieces of glass down and then he went to change

off you shove you in a box this looks
fun is it hard this looks this looks fun as hell is it hard to set up yeah well
actually to be fair I think the hard part to set up is the [ __ ] that auto did
but it's like emulator stuff I didn't do it though I can't lie to you I can't sit here as a man and tell you that it's
easy or hard cuz I didn't do it but I think the not the the [ __ ] that's just the game itself isn't hard it's just
[Music] emulator you wouldn't lie to me I know
that my brother it's [ __ ] true it's [ __ ] true okay this whoa whoa whoa look at my
stats that's phenomenal that's
phenomenal it's kind of bad lowkey because I'm not going to get stab on Psychic moves cuz I have high attack and
low special attack I got
[Music]
sketch okay that could that could hit high this could be good so if I just
sketch like what's the best best physical move it's just is it just earthquake straight up holy [ __ ]
2,95 bits what the [ __ ] I'm ordering dinner I'm not even waiting that you
just paid for dinner thank you I can get something bougie too are

exaggeration but I get the point you could get a lot of fentanyl
for sure how many Harry Potter books you get like phic move off wild Pokemon before the
first trainer since you don't physical move
yet so I should just kind of like sus out who's got what like I'm going to go to kill this
Pidgeotto for uh for XP but if she uses a good move I'll sketch her
no we don't want low kick right I'm just going to kill you you're worth the XP Pidgeotto is the the most
right that didn't give me [ __ ] why' I do that that was stupid as hell wait I don't even need I can I
can on wild so far there's nothing the rules that says I
can't as long as I don't kill them yeah
well [ __ ]
me but I don't have to like wait for my one time okay hold up I'm going to do this I was like considering going P but
I'll hold off what emulator are you using I'm not
using an emulator I'm using the original Hardware OEM

physical low kick what else you got ancient power kind of what
whatever camouflage
uh-oh get me the [ __ ] out of
here ancient power goes crazy does it ancient power is kind of mid it's just that like one in 10 chance that it UPS
all your stats by one
right all right what yall got
skill swap no
overheat no overheat again no okay I'm going to
die to a
[Music] crit this gen's physical special is
split across types not uh moves which is kind of a bummer they didn't
figure out till Gen 4 that that's kind of [ __ ] Cay doll they could have
earthquake astonish we don't care about that jump
kick jump kick is not a move I want to put all my eggs
in okay I got to [ __ ] run
Cav War has PP poo poo physical attack no it's a
randomizer String Shot what's your fourth
move sacred fire nah
ah no I know what you got jump Kick's really good jump kick is not really good
I only get the chance for one physical move jump Kick's crazy the accuracy is
kind of [ __ ] I could maybe do low kick but low Kick's also like
so Sac fire is op I mean it's a good move sure but in this
situation it's not very good follow me recover recover is good but we shouldn't
sketch recover because we just need to hold out for a an actual physical move do you not have an attack
move high jump kick what's the accuracy on that 90 no
ah we can't do high jump kick right that's too
low Morning Sun okay so Pony is not going to be our hero today Kingler what
you got for
me hypnosis all right let's just give it a bite
all right uh this is scary Mega kick dude what is up with
these
moves oh yeah I need to make sure I outspeed it well it's fine I can just sus it out cuz it's all the same point
Crow good luck gamer I don't need luck baby I got something called skill right
so you are a time in throw your head at the wall after enough time monkeys will write Shakespeare I am a you know locked
in dedicated gamer flame wheel flame Wheels special
cuz it's fire Mega kick we seen it uhoh uh-oh got to run I almost just killed
myself mooo milk I feel like nobody's chat uses the
[ __ ] mirror one where it looks like the Pepe and then it looks like the Pepe whose dog [ __ ] stupid more than my
chat Shadow Ball would be crazy Shadow Ball would go crazy well
honestly anything that's physical and 100% accuracy with 80 damage would go crazy like that's kind of what we're
looking for right that's basically the criteria
moonstone Ponyta we already know what you
have there's other Pokemon in this forest for sure right
yeah try attack is really good yep
dude where are your other friends
oh hyper Fang okay it's interesting we will have to
run there's nothing that guarantees harama has like a fighting move or like
a strong physical move I think right it just has to be compatible right
body slam's nuts I think body slam would be good return's your best option I do think return is the most powerful move
for sure dewick I have noticed you have stopped the par Social Club goon stream siding
burnout as a reason well you know who wasn't afforded the luxury of burnout
Saddam Hussein I've never done leer is in pain but you get back in there I've
never done parasocial GL goon clubs just to be clear go to the first grass yeah I
wanted to see the harama but I think it might be a little too hard to find
it earthquake's better I mean earthquake I would love earthquake I just am at the
whim of what Pokemon I find and I don't want to I basically don't want to fight
another trainer until I sketch a move move and it's there's a limited number
of Pokemon and a limited number of moves I could sketch off a trainer it's just like there the next trainer is quite
strong all right what you got Lon Lon that's a tough
name uh that's bad fire
blast slash to be honest slash is pretty pretty
decent we could go for a slash zap Cannon's good zap Cannon is
not physical so it's not good low kick clear slash I don't think I
agree
rockt avoid contact moves were possible what in this example is a
contact [Music]
move low kick is the contact move or
slash Revenge
steel
Wing Spike Cannon uh-oh Spike Cannon is
interesting no it's kind of
[ __ ] why go physical on a special attacker in the bottom right corner
all right grimer what's your fourth move imagine it's earthquake
[Music] Encore okay so I think I just have to go
to reinforc unless I get slash but right now my best options are slash or low kick hold on I got to pee
people G people
[Music]
I I think genuinely he should have killed himself
now you know it's me the way I'm looking at their dicks
all right I'm a coming
bot by the way know of you sent that clip of me earlier to squeaks where I was talking about the B
just cuz I know he does this clip review thing and I feel like some of you guys didn't do that some of you guys watch me and you know it's just
Lo [Music]
in okay I think our best bet is whatever
harama has
wait this is terrifying this is terrifying Umbreon
with the dark move just kills me
no Crush claw doesn't have enough PP I think
we can go look for one more move and then I'm
out this is so dangerous I shouldn't do this
Catch and Release and check the moves you're not allowed to do that you're allowed to catch release but you can't
check any of the
moves catch on Brion she's so defensive don't wor that that stuff isn't true
having said that her stats are better than than gardav
Wares I don't I don't think we should catch the Umbreon
though because it's level
six I think we would have to wait to find a level eight cuz there's no Universe we
would beat the next trainer and that's the only battle we have left we don't have any wild Pokémon
to farm off so we're going to go for another supersonic we're going to go for one more move
check and that we'll run the Rival I don't think the level six embryon is
beating the
Rival Leaf blade why would I sketch guys you don't understand in gen 3 physical
and special is split across types of moves not the specific moves Leaf blade is a special move I am a physical guard
of War you got to keep
up okay we uh we have enough Health to to fish for two other moves
confuse Ray that's a good
move oh I'm
dead dude my attack is so high I do so much damage when I hit myself in
confusion low kick would be good I mean right now it seems like low kick is the best
[Music]
option wait to sketch someone with earthquake I don't have that privilege cuz I have to kill the
upcoming trainers and I don't know if I do that what's your fourth move
[ __ ]
dude okay I might it's just so risky I
might be able to be I might be be able to beat the first trainer without sketching a
move sup gamer
a Mew okay bite will do some damage bubble
beam we do not care about you wow yeah no GG this was such a
[ __ ] mistake I regret it instantly I should have trusted my gut i instead read chat they said wait till level 11
we know chat is stupid why I did this I'll never know yeah no that's that's GG that's as
G GG as it gets [ __ ] stupid of me stupid I know you
guys are [ __ ] dog [ __ ] stupid but I still read your dumb [ __ ] [ __ ] messages oh my God it's
j i I think I dead ass got to close out of chat you guys are too [ __ ] stupid you actually have [ __ ] idiotic brains
wait till level 11 they say [ __ ] I should have just taken slash I knew it was the right
[Music] call [ __ ] you guys are stupid it's bad
game play you're bad at the game I should have trusted myself
[Music]
okay it's all right I lost but I learned a valuable lesson and the lesson
is if I if I'm going to lose it is going going to be on my own
accord if I lose it'll be because I made a bad call in the future not because I listened to chat's bad call that's the
lesson I it's just like League of Legends
bro you realize you're going to fail more saying doing that maybe but at least I'll learn from my failures ra I
don't there's nothing to learn from here it was not like my idea that I
attempted and then fail
that all right I got I got food time to eat food we got a video though
three champions from Spring raising two phenomenal young Stars welcome to the
new era of toast to our Champions disguise toast was a streamer with a
dream he wanted to stand on the biggest stages in the world I was watching every game pretty much watched every scrim
practice trials they had just following along I think this Sky joining the league is very healthy for the league and I think it's very helpful for people
who kind of lost hope but he did something no one expected he rolled into a scene full of former Champions and
proven talent and he won the whole thing but here it goes the is low jumps in
looking for Smoothie smoothie is the first one to fall and first of goes in s
Falls and DSG history in the
making but getting there wasn't easy just winning wasn't enough everybody in Esports is struggling and even trying to
compete can cost millions of dollars we are in definitely a rough period you
could call at Esports winter I thought about it I kind of toyed with the idea but I was like it's a money pit there's
no lying like I've definitely thought like is it even worth being in it it's just a reality Esports don't make money
so it's just nothing but stress and hope and pain mad Lions hold on and the dream
for disguised is over Esports is changing streamers are going
to be a big part of its future but can your favorite creators really save
Esports over the past few years there have been a slew of streamers creating orgs and starting their own teams in
Europe huge orgs like Carmen Corp and movie star Koy got started thanks to massive streamers and influencers and
these days they can sell out stadiums all on their own but building a fan base like that isn't easy or cheap and
neither is getting into the biggest leagues in the world and we're still streamer owned or otherwise Chad if I
have a giant freaking tournament like the French people do and I have all my Esports teams there and I spend $500,000
you show up and hey why did you say no I literally didn't finish my sentence
why did you say no don't why did you say e no why did you add ew to it
a 10,000 person Arena tickets are free tickets are free would you show
up where it would be somewhere drivable that anyone could get to like near
Chicago
okay yeah you can't get there if you're from India true but like you know most people in America get
to we wouldn't serve water the waters would be $100 on site for bottled water
that's where we'd make our money Sports orgs around the world are finding the path to profitability is very very
complicated we are in definitely a rough period you could call it Esports winter
economically speaking it's definitely difficult right now in gaming in general in addition to that there's so many
other problems like over those years where a lot of the ORS got in DC money and the industry wasn't profitable
during those times the orgs ended up paying the players too much money and now these VC firms that own portions of
the company they want their dime back and companies like Riot are working extensively to try to band-aid and fix
these Solutions like which is why you see the classics in the game the marketing that Riot did over VCT really
impressed me they would actively advertise for the team teams from a developer point of view I think they did better than any developer has ever done
when Esports was younger many of the biggest teams were operating thanks to outside investment from Venture Capital
funds the teams Drew in millions of dollars player salaries grew and Esports exploded across North America as it set
down deep roots all around the world but generally speaking these VC funds weren't giving away their money for
free he does got that busting cut eh that his haircut look looks like the
haircut you see on the dude from Madmen what's the Mad Men
guy see what I'm
saying they wanted to see a return on their investment and Over The Last 5 Years everyone has realized the hard
truth your favorite team is probably losing money and like Shan gar said the VC funds wanted to start making money
off the space too and when that didn't happen the money dried up and without funding it's hard to pay staff players
and well have a team in general for a little while crypto companies look like they might be a silver bullet for
Esports orgs but one of the biggest deals hundreds of millions in promised money from FTX to Riot games and TSM
fell apart when FTX dissolved amid Scandal and fraud and these days there's
no two ways about it the industry is shrinking the last 6 months of 20 24
2023 this past year was probably the hardest six months Cloud9 Trump coin think about it that could be a
thing Cloud9 moneys sign Trump that I've ever had we went through three rounds of layoffs in a year and a half I just
needed to sit back and step away so that I could be on the outside looking in again and be a fan of 100 thieves the
financial problems facing Esports organizations are very very real so why
exactly are creators pouring money into it I was really in a smash and that's
how I started streaming and I ended up earning a good amount of money and there was a point in early
20 I think of the OG Esports owners and I don't think many people would argue
that 100 these isn't OG Esports but I think nade probably one of the better
ones because like some of the other owners well some of them are dog [ __ ]
okay TSM Reggie nade just cares so much about his
team still jacket c9's amazing I believe it
and I think Rob's really good I think Rob's really good for like newer Esports ORS actually I don't know how long s been around but at least in my
mind but like so many Esports or owners I don't even know that they
care I'm sure they do I just don't see
it 2020 before Co where one of the largest smash events Genesis one of the
best players of the time Z got dropped by a sponsor and he was just looking for someone to help pay him to go to too
much to be honest and I did it without like this idea of a grand Esports team but just like look young here this was
four months ago don't act like I'm
[ __ ] ugly as [ __ ] old as [ __ ] now it's been it was just four months ago
yeah this was in like November this was at the homrs event
that I did with TK and and tens and and Sean
and I'm sorry to hear that dude I like smash you know I want you to go without losing money so I made this Esports team
and I called it Mogul mov and it was it was mostly a joke and I bought him like Gucci shoes and I made him wear it on
stage he's outside of that um grab into Tipper range so he's doing a beautiful job just maximizing where he's supposed
to go he's going to do it again and he does it again 89% sa playing on fire
right now that was a m move that definitely wasn't MOG shout out to lwig
shout out that's the only shout out I'll ever give to lwig in my life and it's definitely the highest my heart rate has
been I think in the past 10 years and I got into a motorcycle accident recently that was lower cuz it was just like the
tension of like a game five set where you know you have zero outside of
setting this person up for success by just trying to get him a nice hotel or whatever and lo and behold he won the
event tried to catch him with the up air going real high takes Genesis 7 to that was just a
great feeling that I was able to share with with him and in his arms I'm kidding I'm sorry I shouldn't say do
it cuz I'm busy but yeah so you know I thought about it I kind of toyed with the idea
but I was like it's a money pit and so actually Zayn went off to sign to another team and I backed out of eorts
guys we've been watching the Corona virus for weeks now uh continuing to see the market action trade around the
updates we get but the Corona virus is also hitting Esports the co pandemic hit Esports hard with events and tournaments
forced online in a period of uncertainty but online the audience was bigger than ever and a few years after zay's run at
Genesis 7 ledwick got another chance to contribute to the scenes he loved I'm joining as the co-owner of moist Esports
to which you might say aren't you being dumb aren't you being a hypocrite isn't this how you're going to burn all of your money to which I
say maybe and I was like okay well I would take the headache away of like the starting you know cuz like zero to one
in Esports kind of sucks and I'd also be sharing in this journey with a guy who's
in a very similar situation to me so it felt like a right fit and uh and that's
why I started it but lwig had a tough job to do the bottom line is if you want to compete at the highest level of any
esport you have to win in convoluted tier 2 systems and sometimes winning isn't even enough he got to work
eventually signing an upand cominging roster of valerant Pros with the help of FPS Legend sha Gars ladwig's dream was
to roll through tier 2 working his way into to the highly competitive Ascension tournament and then the VCT but in
Esports things don't always go the way you plan meanwhile toast was learning that
even a definitive win in tier 2 isn't always enough to catapult an Esports org
forward DSG winning challengers in North America was definitely a feather in toast cap but it also didn't really
change much for the fledgling organization in League of Legends at the time winning Challengers did not qualify
you for the franchise LCS other than buying a spot after another team left
there was no way to work your way into tier one in North America in a spot costs 10 to 12
million last I checked down from 30
though so that's a steal I think it's it might even be in
the in honestly in the dip it might even be like you probably get one for five mil now
so despite his success with no path to the LCS in sight toast threw most of his attention into valerent I was watching
every game pretty much watched every scrim practice trials they had just following along holding on to cat
holding on from behind that Aftershock and now scuba in a 1 V one does he have any idea that there that there's a man
back has no idea disgu toast has made it
to Challengers I was very excited and I would say say it was one of the best
moments of my career watching the team qualify seeing how happy they are 2v2
it's clear and nerve to try to hold this one back double Nano swarms one of the
mollies has already been utilized neither one of the two Nanos are on site they're finally able to
start diffusing the lock down is done for buor catches one clear with an angle
can he actually take away blackard blackard to losing Defenders win mad Lions hold on and the dream for
disguised is over one enemy remain what a run there for disguised as well it's
been a tough season for them overall up M dude being an Esports owner kind of
sucks it's so sad to lose man it's so sad it happens more often
than not with a lot of shuffling around on this loster the biggest thing was
just team cohesion um we started losing
a couple of times and then we kind of created this culture of like every time there's a loss wow where are we eyeing
next and it made the players kind of scared even under more pressure so we
were good but I think we just didn't know how to handle losses very well and
it kind of just was never able to recover and snowballed and so ultimately after investing more than a million into
his valerant and League teams only to be relegated from the Challenger league in North America toast moved his efforts to
Southeast Asia signing a this time it was enough and now it's
down onto jens's shoulders a one on four almost impossible to ask juy is
here he cleans it up a very decisive win we're going to well done well done to
all the players there was a sense of expectation that they would because if
this is quote unquote the Singapore super team then you're expected to win your region by get margin now before we
jump into them more I want to introduce reintroduce this gu toast our Singapore Squad it was definitely more
nerve-wracking the competition was higher just the first time traveling to an Ascension event playing on land
because in Singapore you don't get to play on land for your finals and the other regions both of them have a land
event so for a lot of them it's the first time playing in person a lot of superstition starts kicking in it's like
oh you know I was sitting like this when we won and I was sitting like that when we lost I'm going to sit like this and
maybe that'll make a difference you know a lot of dsg's future rides on the
success of these games right and the players know that so it's just stress it's just stress it's just nothing but
stress and hope and pain and Jubilation when they win it's a roller coaster it's
just a real reality Esports don't make money only I would say one out of 10
Esports work makes money it's very unfortunate it's it's definitely becoming more of a passion thing and
it's it's a hard to ask for players to kind of like give up their youth to chase a dream that has such a low chance
of paying off now since the end of the 2024 season a few things have changed for to his League of Legends team has
been granted a guest spot in the reformed LCS now LTA so he'll finally have a spot in a tier one lead but he's
also stepping away from his sea valerant team despite their success last year since Riot has announced that they won't
be allowed to stream their games on any platform other than soup and toast isn't the only one who's been struggling with
the brutal highs and lows I didn't know about
that that's crazy
what the hell is soup other than soup and toast isn't the
only one who's been struggling with the brutal highs and lows of
Esports Korean twitch oh it's
Africa oh they rebranded oh
h i mean it's it's all or nothing I think it's a pretty flawed system you know um but I guess it makes it more
sweet if you qualify but it's also more heartbreaking if you lose I definitely think at This Moment's time Challengers
is kind of disappointing at the moment just because there's no incentive for orgs to actually invest into the
challengers especially with it being such a gauntlet like it's actually like cruel you're choosing a career that is
extremely competitive like choosing to be an actor or a musician right the employment rate in these fi is like .1%
the same thing is true for organizations you need to come into something like challenges and you need to have a plan
on how you're going to survive and how you're going to exist in the space and what we've seen in the past couple of
years there's really only two ways to make it work one you either have Deep Pockets and you're willing to make a big
bat because you're looking at ascending as that big payoff or you run a scrappy
creative small team with a small infrastructure small footprint the idea of coming into Challengers and spending
a lot of money hoping to make a lot of Mone it's just not realistic and it's not going to work so teams need to
really adjust how they are operating looking at this moist Mogul roster this team is on the rise even
higher than they've gone already now they're here in playoffs and they're coming off of a dominant group stage run Planet cannot come through though not
immediately orbital strike to get called in that's all used over towards lamp side Jon he's been a playmaker for his
Squad tries to deal with the barrier orb is this the moment Spike still not planted yet it will come down though
eventually Trent doesn't stop it in time down to Brock one V2 both players going to swing this likely together there's
the challenge Brock gets B it's an eay clutch from mogol to strike down the
guard and make it to the winners finals yeah so the reality is we were the best
team going in by record not only were we the best going in we won we made it to Winner's finals and then we went up
against M80 which we knew would be tough and we lost and then we get eliminated no mistakes no mistakes in this post PL
it's already been tapped once that's a big kill he saw the second Sim needs something else here and he's not going to get it which was tough man it was
tough cuz like we were one game away for making it to the Ascension tournament
twice and lost both so ludwick's team came painfully close to making it to the
Ascension tournament in 2023 right now in valer that's the only way for an upand cominging team to make it into
tier one the system is brutal and falling just short twice was a blow but it was also clear that his team had
potential so heading into 2024 they made some changes they had a chance to be acquired by Shopify who have started to
put some serious money into Esports lwig joined up with the same man who helped him sign his team in the first place sha
Gars and they called this new org moist X Shopify and after several roster changes they went into 2024 with big
expectations but that season wound up feeling eerily similar and once again they fell just short of making it to
Ascension a 4v4 rolling thunder Hunter Fury waiting for a sound
CU out first checks the corner under pressure it's Sim yet again and now it's
only fly and it's a 4K I can't believe they made it best of three last year
that's so crazy feel like they just have to leave it best of
five for the Ascension tournament like you got to make that one best of five
out of is that big asend but LG's attitude was different after two years
of almosts at the end of the day I found out through that first year that more important than maybe this like far-fetched goal of mine is like setting
up these kids man like you know teens early 20s like these young pro players careers to be the the best careers they
can be and like setting them up right you know making sure they're they're in a good situation they're they're playing
well and then they're also like taking care of themselves I grew much more attached to the individuals than I maybe
would have expected going in for me like mxm was very secondary to like you know
I mean back then it was like flya and AO and Brock and all the guys so if one has a bad game it's like I hope he feels
confident still I hope he still thinks he's the the [ __ ] cuz he should I love watching ma now
NRG is my favorite tier one team it's not
close I'm a damn F it's definitely like God's work like they they're knocked out I
know bad take that's not a take [ __ ] it's the team I
like that's not how that works putting in a lot of money to just
kind of develop the scene and obviously there's no like real incentive to it you don't really get rewarded for it but it
definitely has really good for the scene and it does help like all these really young talented players develop now the
question is are we now taking too much time away from these players like ma who
was number one player in Challengers if you ask any player in Challengers from expanding his career from going to the
next level right after this year I was totally hands off and I let them feel as many tier one offers as possible cuz I
understand it's unfair to the guys to not let them explore the best career path for them possible NRG announced
their roster they've added ma who's been kind of a demon in tier 2 for quite a while everything seems lovely there
Esports is a tough industry it's brutal it wears you down it's competitive it's
expensive and sometimes it feels like it's impossible to succeed but it's also
a place where fans and Gamers can feel connected part of something bigger at the end of the day that's a big big part
of what we do every day it's probably a big part of why you're watching and for big creators some of that connection is
built in lwig and toast aren't the only ones to have noticed that in Europe kadril is months into running his own
League of Legends team it's early days but hey the B and huge organizations like caring
Corb and movie star koi have their Origins with creators to ebi tomato and
Prime but Lo ronas is different I think cuz it's not calling it just a
Creator or I know kadr is a massive Creator but K Kroll's also um a like
former pro so it changes his level of involvement on the team yeah and it is
frankly a super team it is a super team but the reason
it can be a super team is cuzz like they're all conent crators and down and like they all you know what I mean like it's a little
different it like the only comparison I could think of is like if trick made a Challengers team and he got tens on it
and like I don't know like three other big Val creators I think that would be like more
comparable like I I can't do what kadal does toes can't do what kadal does because we're not good enough at
games just got started a little earlier but today they have thousands of fans who are happy to fill stadiums
I mean I'm sure they probably reached out to to interview him but he don't travel this is all filmed at the
um at the event in Seattle H grounds look Esports
wouldn't exist without a lot of work but it takes a lot of passion too and
there's a good chance that your favorite creators are where they are because they started out by loving something in much
the same way so maybe it's not crazy that they're the ones stepping up and investing in the space they love even if
the return on that investment might not be there yet can streamers overcome all the problems facing the industry as a
whole of course not but they might be able to get some new fans to start watching and whatever Esports looks like
in a few years time one thing is never going to change Contra I liked it it was
a blue buff start I thought it played quite safe one thing that he could work
on is um amumu is really good at taking void grubs he does it very quickly so he
could maybe take the void grubs cuz he only got two of them so I would say get the void grubs the void
grubs get the yes boss too late to b or too late thank you sir you're welcome you mean to we'll take the tips into
massive consideration yeah you just get the void even if even if you don't have mid or top PRI you just get the grubs

squeaks [Music] Pooky lowkey base these are all my bits
please lower the minimum usually stream set minimums because they're forced
to somebody at one point had like 200 bits and they donated five bits out of
at a time and they ruined chat or something it happened to me years ago I can't remember exactly what insided it
but 300 has stopped that from happening you said I look very Kawaii
two eyes at the end of kawaii squeaks two eyes at the end otherwise you wouldn't pronounce it
Kawaii it' be Kawai sorry sorry freaking always do this I always
freaking correct people on mic it's just cuz I'm trilingual just cuz I'm freaking
trilingual that I freaking do all this stuff
dude yeah my hair is fading actually very fast but I'm going to get it touched up later this month for uh for
the for the big game actually squeaks when are you in town are you coming end of
February actually hold [Music] up I was going to say you should
come to the Lakers game I'm going to but who would you
cosplay who would squeaks cause playay Blackbeard oh you could do Uso
you could be a fire Usopp for [Music]
sure why is that it's a skin color [Music] thing similar
[Music]
tones it's not racist it's not racist I'm just thinking of a character that would take the least
amount of work to cosplay like yes he could cosplay Nico D Robin and he could imp implant massive
tits and he would look great but it would just be a lot more work than to do a character he already looks somewhat
similar to is that crazy is that crazy to say I already have reddish hair I'm
going for Shanks can I cause play like Luffy sure just be a little harder
[Music] it's not a microaggression that's not a micro I'm not micro
aggressing if anything it's a major aggression thank you squeaks see yeah
it's a [Music]
macroaggression what if he had dreams outside the box I don't think he's ever seen one piece and I think he talks down on people who watch anime I'm pretty
sure actually he said he watched anime recently all right while we wait do you
guys want to open a Pokemon pack sorry I don't watch One Piece cuz I had sex in high
school do you guys believe squeaks lost his virginity in high school cuz I
don't what what do you mean I definitely lost my virginity in high school no you
didn't [Music]
I refuse to live in a world where squeaks lost his virginity before me
frankly and so if it was before me I'm going to start lying that's it I'm going to keep it
99 I'm saving it for someone special that's what I'm saying come to the game
oh my God I spilled water no check my Pokemon cards

Pokemon yeah okay let's do it

rock a protect okay he's going to rock a horn attack I think we go straight for an
outrage [Music]
I think we go back to the outrage and we just need it to hit and if it's a crit we
win if it's a crate we wi that's easy
GG chat I saw the prediction was 47 to 53% if you are not voting no you are
basically burning your money okay guys this is very hard I'm not going to lie it's very hard
it's like an we should be basically be losing eight out of every 10 runs
[Music]
all right I'm seeing the prediction on this one is 8020 I think that's more
accurate silk scarf I'm going to wait cuz I think some people been cheesing the predictions by waiting till they see
what I
get bossom is very good my opponent has a pineco that's that's a very favorable
fight this is a very favorable fight here pineco is not the
best match up but it's decent
[Music]

special attack is stupid good and its attack is stupid
[Music] good awom only learned turns two moves
and the next move is at level 44 let's switch to
[Music] Gyarados all right chat what do you want

[Music]
but what do [Music]
beep [Music]
beep all right congrats or boois or
[Music] boois thank you very much to our Bell
awesome for getting us through the hardest part of the game
and or buis we look forward to what you're going to be able to do for us now what the hell is the ability white
smoke all right this guy has a calm nature Which is higher special defense lower attack which normally is bad for a
Gyarados but I actually really like the stats of this Gyarados a little low in speed but the defense special attack and
special defense are very nice prevents ability
reduction okay cosmic power crunch crunch is really good hydro
cannon not as good as like a surf but still very good and then bone Rush which is actually kind of bad so pretty good
moves actually all things considered crunch is really really good [Music]
and we should probably go get the black
[Music] glasses and now we have a very very
strong Gyarados where I'm really only terrified of of course prug with this guy any
Thunder moves [Music] and we're going to grab this bad boy
silver powder
okay uh we can battle any Pokemon out here if we want some XP so there's a
Lombre a Bulbasaur I don't think Bulbasaur is too much Lombre is not too
much either there's a third Pokemon I think

like this otherwise it won't count or your perab band I'm excited to see what you look

[Music]
XP maybe not he's a little bit strong
covet 40 his defense is
insane are we speed tying what is he doing Revenge what what is this move what is it a speed
tie is Rock two Mo last or something what's going
on oh [ __ ] this is really bad
why oh no I should have used a potion [ __ ] that was stupid to me I I
got complacent because I was moving first I should have used the potion then did it but I wanted to do it then use the potion on the third character you
threw possibly but he had a third Pokemon to be honest and I ran into a trainer with a Lugia and a ludos it like
what am I supposed to [ __ ] do bro he had a [ __ ] Lugia
bro ju just out of curiosity just out of curiosity I I just want to
know this doesn't count I want to know what the third Pokemon
is God damn it that sucks so bad in Another Universe I just win that
[ __ ] easy bro threw so hard to be clear I did the
same thing both times so it wasn't
me I didn't do anything more clever he just did [ __ ]
Dumber damn it bro
I was trying to think of who pokey's rival is then I realized
[Music]

it's true I did this when I went to the bathroom earlier it's why it took so
long congrats just Corey haven't we had a Corey before wait
didn't we have literally this exact Cory [Music]
before congrats Cory he lived I remember
scam well he didn't die last time Corey you might not be so lucky
this time uh I'm not going to lie Corey your moves
are leaving something to be desired [Music]
man I actually think the only move I can do in this spot is vice
grip Cory you did not get lucky twice
[Music]
[Music] middle no right
[Music] can't take it wait Reggie steel doesn't
count right Reggie steel is a steel Type
legendary Pokemon okay here's the issue if I don't
choose Reggie steel then I would have to choose AR
Maldo the issue is our Maldo if I choose him is
going to mean my opponent gets Reggie
steel which is kind of [ __ ] in my mind you can pick
Cason that's also [Music]
[ __ ] I just have to go armaldo I
guess I mean it is winnable it's always [Music]
winable thank you very much to CJ person
all right we have static which is actually
kind of
nice yeah I think we just have to go with iron
tail I don't think this is winable for sure
[Music] I think our only bet is Iron Tail and it reducing its
defense that was so [ __ ] lame
[Music]
right good chice CH he gets great
[Music]
choice I'm deleting and returning the channel points cuz you guys are all [ __ ] scum who waited until they saw the Pokemon
whoever's running them you can stop the channel points if you can in the future that'd be
nice uh all right that's
[Music]
[Music] more grease than a Taco Bell Crunch Wrap it's because I keep negotiating time
away from my shower right now to play morth Path of Exile 2 I am hard addicted
and a large reason why I've got this needle in my veins like it's heroin is
because Elon Musk rage baited me into it when he had the whole you know hoopla
with him having a boost someone said Charlie made a video about you and I didn't know if that was real and I got
click baited oh it might be the crazy Sports situation
video account that he piloted really poorly through his live streams it made me want to grind the game even more I
had already liked the game but I had kind of petered off on playing it for like 5 six hours a day and then after
seeing that and then him finally admitting to having people play his account for him it just made me just
[ __ ] go Hog Wild into grinding this myself now I have over 160 hours I've changed my build four times and I am
just the optimal meta build right now and I'm having a great time but it made
me want to dive even deeper into the topic of Rage bait because he didn't do it on purpose he's just a dog [ __ ] gamer
who is a fraud but the idea of Rage bait is something that everyone knows is
really effective when it comes to engagement which is why so many blue check mark Twitter accounts are
constantly farming rage bait because they make money on off it and when people are angry they are constantly
engaging with the thing that makes them mad they can't help but just poke on it and just stay there and tinf foil condom
conspiracy time it's also one of the big things I think AI is being utilized for by meta when they made that huge
announcement about how this Instagram is going to be flooded with AI accounts I think a big thing they're going to do is
engagement Farm through rage bait with their flesh organic sentient users so
you're going to have these AI accounts that are constantly trying to pick apart your insecurities or feed you stories
that are going to make you mad because when you're mad you are locked in on the thing that is upsetting you and you stay
on the the platform think that's going to be a big thing that their AI accounts are used for but we all know this we all
know how big rage bait is right now because it is such a good engagement tool while you see journalists
constantly scrambling to get the most incendiary headlines out immediately because you get the clicks but aside
from just engagement farming it is also an extremely effective marketing strategy which which is why it's become
such a successful and popular Trend with marketing mobile games does I'm sure a lot of you have seen these before where
either it's a fake game but the game play is someone playing something really poorly usually it's you're shooting
these people and it makes a bigger number and you got to move left and right and whoever is doing it is really
bad at it and also that game doesn't exist you're you end up buying like some kind of farming Sim bootleg knockoff
even Anthony star [ __ ] homelander couldn't resist suckling on the teeths to get a taste of that sweet milk that
they produce and it's the same [ __ ] different toilet it's bad gameplay he's
the spokesperson for it but the bad gameplay is integral to selling these mobile games now I'm not a rage bait
psychologist or anything so I don't fully understand why it works so well but there is something a little demon
embedded deep in all of our souls that when it thing is pathetic is this mobile game gameplay it makes us want to try it
to do it better than what we just watched because that was trash that was actually tragic and it works it gets
people into the door to try these games and the most notable example of this it's one from very recent memory lwig
with League of Legends oh shut up I'm sure he's not thrilled that I keep bringing this up but I think this is the best example one that I think would
warrant a real case study to see the correlation between Ludwig's bad gameplay on his climbed the plat and an
influx of new players to the game itself at least temporar because for those that don't know lewig
was doing this challenge where he was going to hit platin League of Legends except he was beyond horrible at the
game like I'm not going to sugarcoat it we're not pulling any punches here I'm not here to you know Pat him on the back he was absolutely so bad at that game I
would sit there and watch his streams for hours and just stew like just sit here and steam speaking to myself out
loud how can he be this bad and it was such a profound effect I thought this video is about Elon [ __ ] musk I
thought about Elon [ __ ] musk and about how he godamn played P Exile and now he's playing P the
Exiles I'm going to the
alt-right oh my God
watching him be this bad at the game it made me come out of retirement fall off the wagon I was sober from League of
Legends for over four years I hadn't touched the stuff I was an avid addict for a while I eventually kicked the
habit and it I I broke my sobriety because lwig was so bad at the game it made me feel compelled to get in there
to prove it's not as hard as he's making it look now eventually over time lwig was able to overcome this hurdle and he
was able to make it to Plat huge congratulations the plat Patriot did it he was successful in his Venture but it
was an extremely rough journey and it served as this really impressive lightning rod that I'm sure riot games
couldn't help but thank him for they probably had like a [ __ ] bubblegum tribute statue to him like Helga from Hey Arnold because of all the new
players he most likely brought in through his bad gameplay him streaming that game for [ __ ] 6 hours a day 10
hours sometimes probably did so I think I streamed I mean I must have been the biggest League streamer in the world for
the month that I streamed it cuz I had like 200
hours kadr kadal wasn't streaming kadr wasn't streaming I don't
think kadr had like an hour in the time that I because this is after worlds but but while he was on
vacation he was in Japan I think so I think that month is just me
for 200 hours the next most stream person must have been like 70
hours Jesus thank you for the raid I ate your pie oh my gosh Chad I ate your pie
is here if you don't know I ate your pie
well he's actually typing it in chat made this made freaking what we are playing right
now what up I at your pie welcome um I'm not going to lie I don't [ __ ] with it
just to be clear you know I know you made it thank you for the good luck I don't [ __ ] with what you made here we're
going to use eruption we can't even use it this is stupid as [ __ ] man it's
stupid cuz now I have to freaking reset because I picked a Slowpoke and I and I
should have picked
alaria hero name lwig rival
name
I eight year
bye okay all right fine it's fine fine [Music]
fine all right I see it's literally just pure luck if you guess right I'm going to go for the
middle not bad now who's my rival going to
get okay this is good it's an actual winnable one
we love when it's actually
winnable so much to make people so angry at his gameplay that they felt the need
to try it themselves to see if it really is that hard or to see if they were better than him which a lot of people
probably felt they were myself included so it got me in the door playing League again now all of a sudden I've do I've
done I've done some solo quue I'm actually [ __ ] malfunctioning cuz my brain is trying to reject the idea that
I'm grinding League again but I've been doing solo qu I am playing League again and I plan on grinding League again
whereas I was sober until L's terrible gameplay I just find it so interesting
how effective rage bait is because it's not just like a flaw with me rage bait is something that you can very clearly
see works you can see the most engaged posts on any social media platform are
going to be the ones that are making people angry it's very rarely something positive that
all right well we're still going to give the Pokemon to someone actually you know what we'll run a freeb one we'll want a
freeb One nobody will be named after this Pokemon so none of you are at
risk uh although I do think this is a pretty easy one I'm going to rip you up
to to little shreds with arrow blast
yeah he just has Mega horn so sick that is so [ __ ] sick
traction is something negative or something that's making people mad and you can now see it in marketing material
where when someone is playing something poorly or doing something that doesn't make sense to sell a product it makes
people more likely to try it another good example of this is those videos that always pop up on Tik Tock and
everywhere else where it's like DIY [ __ ] how to fix a blown out Tire using a
carrot save hundreds of dollars on tire repair using a carrot and toothpaste and
it'll just show them doing this unbelievably inefficient repair that will never actually work with like a [ __ ] carrot or like I broke my sink
with the sledgehammer now I'm really upset but don't worry luckily I had five shoelaces in my garage here's how I can
fix my whole sink using just these shoelaces and it's this wild elaborate [ __ ] Rube Goldberg machine to bring
the sync back to life and you watch it and you think to yourself this is so stupid that's not ever going to work but
those posts get so much engagement and like the point is the whole reason I'm rambling and ranting is I just find rage
bait to be such a strong tool now that people are starting to see companies
individuals and it's so interesting to me because now I'm 160 hours deep in Path of Exile 2 whereas a week and a
half ago I would still just be casually playing it like an hour or two here and there but now I am so laser focused on
this game all because Elon Musk dreamed himself being a fraud gamer that that is
such a wild concept to me and I imagine I'm not alone in that I'm sure for a lot of people this isn't some kind of
shocking Revelation but I guess for me I just never really stopped to think about
look at the sheen on my would I be this deep in the game if
Elon Musk didn't play it so shittily no I wouldn't have so yeah I I just kind of
wanted to talk about this a little bit almost kind of like a pseudo cry for help cuz I've been up till 5:00 a.m. the last four nights playing Path of Exile
too uh point is though rage bait really effective [ __ ] really really effective
that's that's about it see you
okay that video hurt my feelings congrats Abby Abby the
loser don't botch this one to be fair I this is not an e easy
one make me a winner Abby space loser
okay you know what I'm going to increase your odds hurtful that's their
name I I will literally give you no I actually really shouldn't give
you this calcium low key cuz we're not going to keep you if you get past this because your speed is
abysmal pound Harden OCT bazooka crunch okay you have crunch we win
[Music] this I think we should be fine here yeah we should win
this H GG SP a little soon
there let SP a little bit soon there Abby yeah that's a
GG that's GG Abby nothing you can do about that
one if we wake up here we
win if we wake up here we
win GG that's actually
massive I still don't think we're going to keep the Alakazam long term although wow you gained a lot of
XP because you just have very low speed set like it's very
low congratulations Believers like our speed is
eight that's tough
I can't even run from a level five I'm level eight n this is this is
scary here's my current game plan I want to get to the bush to the left because
that poke that bush has level eights this bushes only have level fives so I don't care about a Cacnea or whatever
the hell else is in this uh tall grass and and then when we're over there we'll
catch our level eight and we're going to bring it back here to level up a
[Music] bit svper is interesting I should
actually definitely heal though because I cannot
trust uh this Alakazam Sur Viper is interesting I
think a bit too weak though with drought
interesting surviver with drought in water pulse and we're going to lose to
[Music] it do we pay off for last win
mods Kabuto definitely not
okay let's maybe go north spell
tag This Tall Grass might have something goldine not so not so
viable can't escape sucks
I have to catch it otherwise I
lose we are catch and releasing this fish
[Music]
so am I no longer allowed to catch somebody in this bush what's the deal with this
bush you can w
okay why should I keep coming back to this [ __ ] Bush where there's a [ __ ] goldine who keeps [ __ ] me
look at this freaky airm Harden pound crunch octazooka this Alakazam a freak
on God no HFR
[Music]
I de I think I throw a Pokeball in
prey we will pivot to melodic [Music]
all right if you'd like to be entered for the giveaway to win melodic you must type the phrase in chat
[Music]
[Music]
uh Eric Leaf
[Music]
congratulations all right Eric we
uh we have to first
release the Alakazam or sorry deposit the Alakazam and we can just deposit the
gold it's fine all right so let's take a look at what we got here we have gig drain rock slide bone rush so pretty
good moves gigar drain's very powerful uh as far as our stats we're
more attack than special attack right now but we do have a nature that makes
it so our speed goes up and our attack goes down love our or sorry special defense goes up our speed is still
pretty bad the moves are pretty good helps repel wild Pokemon I love that I
love that Lord knows I love that all right it's not the greatest
right now stats are kind of stinky I agree but I think we stick with
it lowkey
I don't know why I thought that would give more XP I know that those little [ __ ] don't give any
XP sa Viper dude I my speed is so
embarrassing I might catch a level eight C Vier and replace this melodic to be honest
don't this melodic kind of
blows don't get the drought version yeah yeah I guess drought would
be kind of bad with water pulse it's really good with overheat
though don't get it well it looks like I might not have a choice here okay there we go no I got to try trust my gut lwig
trust your [ __ ] gut [ __ ] these hoes in chat they don't know
[ __ ] dude [ __ ] I hate not being able to [ __ ] run from [ __ ] so
tilting it's genuinely the [ __ ] worst feeling
[ __ ] this maddening
holy
[ __ ] oh God damn it God damn it
okay all right okay there is a third Pokemon in this
area but I am not getting the Fortune to run into
it I'm a newish l bud and totally new to Pokemon why is it called iron L what's
the law I'm a newish l bud and totally new
to Pokémon why is it called iron L what's the law
what am I looking for there's a third Pokemon in this brush that's the
guy uh now unfortunately he's not that strong
dude [ __ ] me [ __ ] me good okay now I'm looking for a surviver
that I can kill because I know but I want it to be at least like a level eight or six I'll take a six I'm not
greedy so I can gain XP so I can be stronger than vidiian
Forest I I'll just take this I don't
care okay hold up for at least this section
I'm just going to turn off the
sound I'll just play some
all right okay sorry chat yeah this is an iron uh uh an iron mud it is a very
small alteration from a concept made by the person who just raided us actually I ate your pie and simply put we are
trying to beat the game with a set of rules the rules are available to read if you just do exclamation
point or just look at the pin comment there there's a lot there's too many rules for me to just say them there's a
whole bunch of them but the gist [Music] is uh I am not allowed to level up my
Pokemon by fighting random other Pokemon in the wild so my alternative is cuz I can only
fight one Pokemon or catch one Pokemon per area really deeply considering what
is available in the area and then making an informed opinion off that if I want
to swap or if I would like to level up off the
Pokemon so for example right now my melodic is only level six melodic is a good Pokemon you can see in the bottom
right next to BST that's the base stats of so like it it's it has the ability to
be really strong right it just has a higher ceiling it was born better than the rest
of the Pokemon now this specific melodic lowkey kind of missed
okay just being real lowkey kind of mid doesn't have the best speed doesn't have
you know whatever I think we kill
it I think we killed the Poli [Music]
R level eight Pol that should get us a level
[Music]
so anyway yeah we're just looking we're just looking for for different Pokemon like that and now we've run into a grass
dark type and we are what I guess you would call
[ __ ] cuz this type kind of hard counters me in kind of every way shape and form
it's just kind of GG we're going to reset the
Run yep that's sick so normally a kaiso iron
Manon is like a lot of rules and then you can only have one Pokemon today this is day one we're doing just one Pokemon
tomorrow we're going to add another Pokemon the day after we're going to add another Pokemon until we reach six
but for today we're doing just
[Music]
one cuz I wanted to experience you know just a taste it's not a full Kao iron
Monon regardless because it doesn't have the ultimate ironon rulle set but just a taste of like the RNG aspect of an iron
Manon there's still be RNG even in like an ironon where you're allowed six Pokemon obviously in like the PC fight
but there's just a lot less RNG later on now I don't even think obviously it's
easier when you have more Pokemon it's still hard though because you still have
to divide the experience which is very limited across of your across your Pokemon's move set
[Music]
yeah you could probably swap out Pokemon and use them to tank heal all right we got primeape which is really good our
opponent is going to have a melodic and a Brum is
available okay well this are B we lay in
[Music]
it so I don't get to pick the starter it's
RNG so I I I just click one of the three randomly and whoever I click I have to get and my my opponent my rival will
automatically pick whoever is to my left
[Music]
and the only difference between an iron Mon and an iron L is that we name every Pokemon after a viewer like fingas and
if fingas dies we permanently ban him
forever fingas has a good move set though hypnosis snore Rock toomb Blaze
kick sorry he has a horrible move set but for the purposes of the first fight hypnosis could
hit is that true yeah we' have banned like 40 people the amount of people we've banned is insane
already fissure oh yeah oh
congratulations congratulations you win
[Music] it's a Perma ban no you are banned until the run is over now the good news for
fingas is fingas is oh fissure only works if I'm a level
higher
[ __ ] [ __ ] I
forgot fling it's it's not good news bro it's [ __ ] bad news bro it's [ __ ]
bad [ __ ] news bro it's bad [ __ ] news bro you threw
I don't know if I threw I would have done hypnosis and then
what snort what could I have done
[ __ ] my chungus life
bro okay we're going to go middle Crobat
amazing our opponent Magmar pretty good
Clamperl the only bad one here okay this is
dicey oh the move set is leaving stuff to be
desired it is leaving stuff to be desired good speed decent attack although the attack
is irrelevant as my move set this is tough this is tough bro
[Music]
all right congratulations to our
Crobat Lord femore Lord farore you are our Crobat
and I won't lie this is a
[Music]
5050 okay
uh well actually you know what you have rest
which synergizes Super well with early
bird so that's kind of interesting
all right I'm
[Music] thinking I'm thinking faint attack is
literally the only option there's just no other
moves for more you don't have to say I'm not going to say slurs it should be implied
[Music]
he changes type oh now we can use bullet
seed maybe he only has [Music]

[Music]
[Music] do anyone see Kanye's West's wife's butt
and ass and also vagina in everything that could you could possibly see on a
[Music] person she had her eagle out bro it was
it was flying it was flying high
bro it was kind of weird it's so funny to see the different reactions around the world because like I think America
reaction is like man that's kind of weird like Kanye it feels like Kanye is forcing her to do that and then you know
there's some like more prud companies like their countries like I saw like you know it's like Japan outraged going to
pull Kanye West tour and then it's like Europeans Europeans are the weird one
here because that's just British TV they have a show there's a real show
in the UK where they just show people butt ass naked
and then they they play Tinder they swipe they eliminate People based off how their toes and their [ __ ]
look it's called naked attraction it's on YouTube the show starts and it shows
a naked person's ankles and then it it slowly lifts the screen and it's just their [ __ ] or vagine depending what
they're packing and then it Scrolls up and then it's just the yabas and then
it's the face and the person who's playing swipe left or swipe right after
choosing the person they want has to then show up butt ass naked next to the host who's just fully clothed and the
host who's fully clothed is like yeah nah so like how's that make you feel being butt ass naked next to the person
now like you feel strong or it's crazy so they saw that Kanye West [ __ ]
and like to be honest they probably just went straight to judge
mode they're probably like damn she do great on naked
attraction uh we're [ __ ] by the way we lose I'm glad more brands are recognizing you for being litins very
heartwarming in these current times buying a big bag of tus now to support
hash Latins we only have needle arm bro this is so [ __ ] I use momento it
instantly kills you I'm not stupid now good news it's only using
neat uh fake tears okay I mean we're
winning the issu is I'm running out of PE
[Music] PE it has double
kick oh God I think I win maybe via PP proxy war
[Music] no I'm going to lose the proxy war
because eventually I'm going to have to use [ __ ] momento and I'll just instantly
die this is so [ __ ] stupid
bro I'm going to lose I'm going to lose the [ __ ]
War this is so [ __ ] all because I have [ __ ] ass momento dude I would win
if I didn't have a fourth move you can't beat this I can't I can't
beat it you're you're
[Music]
wrong use momento you won't die check for an Elixir I don't have
[ __ ] Bro the game just started started can I use a water stone on
[Music] it I mean I played it I think about as
well as you
can I have to kill myself what a [ __ ] up game this is it re it stripped me of
all my options and it made me kill myself [ __ ] me
that's it just out of options kill yourself I didn't fall for it Luda it's
all I could have done okay it's all I could have done [Music]
bro uh okay I'll name myself
Aiden you know who hates to see Aiden coming
big ass bucket of
popcorn hate to see him
coming we went to the movie theater Aiden bought a large bucket of popcorn I
am not exaggerating [Music]
the bucket was
[Music] literally I'm trying to get like
a banana for comparison it was this bucket of
popcorn it's like a cartoonish sized popcorn
he ate the whole thing by the way this is the same guy
who has been 165 lbs while being 6'2 for like 8 years cuz he doesn't eat well he
can't eat we're going alt right might's a great pick Cason is what I would have gotten
now my opponent gets this is actually winable
[Music]
chess say what you will I actually think Elon Musk has been a horrible horrible person for America
wow that's cringe
everyone loves to call me a fence sitter but I'm seeing all of you type that I'm on the other side of the fence okay
maybe I stand alone but I stand there
firmly fry fish
congratulations I didn't realize I had that many glazers fry
fish I looked up make it attraction I could not believe that was real I got flashbanged by a line of [ __ ] why do
you know that show exists don't don't sorry don't see something be appalled by
it and be mad that I'm worldly
okay yes I am worldly sorry
[Music] all right let's take a look we got a
mighta with Magma armor which is useless mean look Mega kick which is decent
brick break which is pretty good and transform which transforms into a copy of the foe with even the same move set
who wait what a transform Mighty an that's kind of
sick we have a ditto
uh I don't think we want to be a Ditto in this case I think we just want to use the move brick break and and win now
having said that this might hurt I think we just
lose oh never mind we win never mind we lose I was too excited I thought tackle wouldn't do enough damage I mean we
played it
well you had six defense did not see that
[Music]
[Music] favorite go-to movie snack I I I've
evolved
wait who wants to fall in the sword
one of you is just going to get banned like this is just an instant ban there's is really no
but yeah my go-to movie snack used to be bunch of crunch but I think they got rid of a bunch of crunches the last few times I've been to
a movie theater I haven't seen it so I used to always get bunch of
crunch I don't know what happened to it how far is he in the game shut the
[ __ ] up Alex you know damn well I have made zero [ __ ] progress
don't don't for a don't for a
second what's the farthest you've gotten to I've gotten to the first gym leaders
first trainer twice in 7 and a half
hours 7 and 1 half hours I just realized how long it's been wow that's how long
for [Music]
sure oh did I not show the
fight yeah you lost
[Music]
alter think of the Prime [Music]
[Music]
so anyway because they got rid of a bunch of crunch I I've moved on
to something really gross I shouldn't even say it you guys are going to judge
me I just get an ice cream sandwich in a bottle of water
I know but but but because I like to eat
while the movie is going I wait until like 20 minutes in to eat it
so usually it's like almost melted at that point and then I'm able to eat it while
enjoying the film cuz because the whole point of a
movie snack is to eat it during the
movie so I got the ice cream sandwich it's like the uh it's like the what's
the the people who make uh chocolate chips to to to something with a te
something with a te Toll House T till House toll house right so I got the Toll
House ice cream sandwich it's melted I open the bag I suck out the cream and
then The Middle's usually still cold enough cuz the outside's the only part that's melted and I eat that through the
bag oh brick break we could win
this that's vile no no okay sorry I don't eat
through the bag like I don't eat the bag itself it's just in the confines of the bag and I slowly slide it out so it
doesn't get
anywhere fissure doesn't work yet unless I'm a higher
level if we hit this brick break I think we win though it's 4X if we hit ourselves in confusion we lose
[Music] we could still win cuz he only did eight
damage with confusion the issue is if we hit ourselves in confusion we're [ __ ] so it's really going to come down to a
coin flip and you [ __ ] lost the coin flip
MC cudley and you [ __ ] lost the [ __ ] coin flip buddy that's tough it's
[Music] tough Alex what's Alex's rival
Nick I thought it was bad vibes like an Ambiance that you wouldn't
gel with or to be
honest hate that's so much better I've just seen what the wheel
does to you
all right what side we going Alex you got you got something in your balls telling you a certain one two
three mid okay Sabal is not like specifically
strong but they have zero weaknesses so that's a pretty sick pick now the one we could have had is Nuzleaf which is worse
very clearly worse Nuzleaf has a lot of weaknesses the Pokemon we're GNA have to go
against interesting zangus zangus is for sure stronger but we don't have any
weaknesses so we could win this damn we got Shadow Ball and sacred
fire and fire blast it's doable it is for sure going
to the movie theaters and spending 50 hard-earned bucks on tickets and popcorn and you get in the theater with a guy
laughing at the dumbest [ __ ] possible as loud as he can and then slurping ice cream out of a
bag okay I don't laugh first all you're making me seem like a bad Patron I sure
do I occasionally laugh maybe slightly you know I I would call it
uniquely do I laugh uniquely yeah do I find light in moments where
people see Darkness sure does that make me a villain I don't know I guess depends who you talk to OG's in chat say
[Music]
hi okay let's see we have soft sand that's all we can do what is limber
hold up I want to see what this is okay prevents paralysis so we have
Shadow Ball but yeah we just want to rip I'm pretty sure we just rip sacred fire
[Music] against dams and [Music]
Goose he's a normal type yeah that's why I shouldn't do Shadow
Ball Thunder Punch is pretty uh pretty
chill this go Inn this go win
[Music] oh we're [ __ ] oh we're [ __ ] that didn't do
any damage what's going on why did that do no damage what's going on you have not even that bad special
attack is there a difference in Burn chance with sacred we should go for fire blast instead of sacred fire
[Music]
sacred fire is a 50% chance of burn well [ __ ] dude
[ __ ] we we were doing no damage there stabilized stats are pretty bad yeah
damn bro we we were doing nothing to that guy
[Music]
all right slime what's slime's [Music]
rival [Music]
uh I I don't have enough characters to write people who talk
so I'll just put
[Music] Ops Kings Rock okay that's kind of sick
I think we go right that's really
bad that's not bad n we're [ __ ]
[Music]
srew all right before we go into battle
[Music]
we got a holographic energy it's not really boating well I
think not to be the Boating police here but that's not a great
bod uh it was Genesis with a J yeah CH who's going to Genesis
it's the biggest Smash tournament it's happening uh next weekend Valentine's Day weekend Tim you're
going medy Cham for sure I just hit you with good
oldfashioned mud shot I'll go if you fly me there I'm
chill out that oh hell yeah mud shot again mud shot doesn't lower accuracy
lower speed you're thinking of something else he hits me with a sweet
kiss confuses me I'm confused now wait if I'm confused is facade
uh do more
no so I think I just keep going down the mud shot train cuz it might flinch
yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] thank you CX bar for the prime
is CX bar the ones that have like six ingredients and they stick to your teeth
what like tar that's an RX bar oh yeah
all right let's be Disney what is Disney's
rival Florida we're talking about Walt it's
it's the Jewish [Music] people the
[Music] gays Netflix
making good movies I got
you new
IP ion I think we're going to go right swallon
is very good we could have picked up a Staryu and let's take a
look a that's so winnable bro electri that's actually such a good
matchup damn our items are or our moves are really really really really horrendously horribly bad though holy
[ __ ] these moves are dog [ __ ] bad
I haven't opened it yet SWOT trapinch some Glacier guy
holographic someone yeah holograph oh Pia right or
is it yeah Pia and then lattos
shame all right congratulations honey [Music]
Mogul ah speaking of [Music]
Honey big fan bro
white herb yeah let me [ __ ] use an iron on
him why not all right we have very high special defense
we have good regular defense our attack is
horrendous uh I think we just have to use Spike
Cannon and hope it hits five times
yeah this is tough we only win if this hits five times and one's a
[Music] crit this could do it this could do it this could do it
[Music]
okay come on dude please God please left nice
[Music] ni oh [ __ ] okay it's still winnable but
man of course we have to go against big gardav
war dude I think I might be allergic to something in my old age like I might have found a new
allergy I meant to write poo poo but I instead I write oi oi
I've been sneezing so much the past two days it's I've never sneezed this much in my life I wonder got
mold all right here's our first card is trash let's take a look at what we
got one two three and our special card is
bad all right zero IQ [Music]
you all right tm45 so let's take a look at our move set we have sing metronome
psycho boost Fire Punch it's actually a decent move set we should probably consider using tm45 depending on what it
is
[Music] rock throw our attack is lower than our
special attack so I don't think it's actually necessary we have quite an allaround fighter here what's our
ability UPS water moves in a pinch going to be pretty useless I think we just kind of jump
into the fight uh let's go with
sing and we instantly die before we get to play a move [Applause]
don't say deserve don't say [ __ ] like that don't say [ __ ] like that maral don't say [ __ ] like that
[Music]
that's not how you use that stuggy that's a bit stuggy bro
[Music]
[Music]
yeah what happened to the [Music]
[Music]
graves luxury ball those are fun let's go uh let's go mid Krabby the other
option was electrode electrode and a krabby would have been great instead we get Krabby into what would be good like sunkern

okay all right come on baby we got this [ __ ] we got this
[ __ ] left middle right okay one person from Paul's chat pick left middle
right right okay huntail okay that's what we get the
other option would have been a nitan and I I thought of this new idea instead of seeing what the third Pokémon is we're
just going to see it in [Music]
[Music] battle what if it's a fave oh
true I think we take that chance to be honest though oh no what happened oh
right wait why isn't it working oh there we
[Music] go congratulations
vano
[Music] Vango sneez okay it's a
sneez which is somewhat fine we have very high attack which is great so we
should just use drill peek and we probably win hopefully
win I'm not showing the screen my bad I'm still not showing the
screen all right so we're going to rock the drill Peck he's using Swords Dance
which is I mean horrifying CU our defense is pretty low but you know so
it's going to take us three hits okay that's pretty bad cuz he
a crit here would be nice do I fall asleep this turn do I if
I get to hit him I win I
win [ __ ] yes he might not have had an attack move to be
honest that is
massive we don't gain a lot of EXP though we're probably going to have to Pivot off this character soon we leave
the lab boys all right this is the last time we
are ever going back to the lab tol keep these in the back of our minds tol is an interesting Pokemon it's
pretty high stats but uh bit of a generic
typing weak to water
ground is there a death counter there's a reset counter but only it's not permanently on the
screen Doug Trio is actually quite weak oh no does it have Arena
trap okay no no
[Music] no I mean low key do I switch to tol now
cuz I think muddy water is a really really good move but we don't have any special
attack okay let's consider an option to swap tropus has too many weaknesses I
think actually how many weaknesses does tropies have
[Music]
[Music] Forex weak to ice weak to rock weak to
[Music] fire I think forx is just kind of a deal
breaker it's weak to Flying actually
right kill it I don't know if I want to keep hunting tail I'm thinking I don't to be
honest there's another Pokemon in this area I'm trying to see what it
is that's pathetic cute but
pathetic there's two more yeah but the third one's spawn rate is like 4% or
something kill tropus but I don't think I'm keeping huntail and I I don't I
don't get to kill tropus is good stats it's true but Forex weakness is just too much of a risk in this run to ever
consider it let's go north hyper potion that's
wonderful oh nid Queen that's interesting n Queen with water
pulse ilum is pretty
useless yeah I don't think we would keep nid Queen long turn but can it get us through Verdian forest and to Brock's
gym I think a level eight nid Queen does that so I think that's what I'm going for here I think
I I think I pry a a level eight nid Queen over our current
huntdale little worried about the move set Lon is somewhat interesting
[Music] check the forest I guess I
could give me a Porygon venonat surely not predictions yeah prediction is do I
beat [Music] Brock uh
no beauly is weak they kind of did beyly they did most bug Pokemon dirty the
people who ran Nintendo were they were just very oh I lost oh my [Music]
[Music]
God I broke my own rules this is my fault I should have listened to myself all I wanted to do was catch the n Queen
the n Queen was totally serviceable it would have got me through all the areas I didn't have to look it was a stupid
decision I read chat and I listened to it it's my fault for reading chat in the future I will close out of chat and I
will not make the error
again Paul yeah you can see right now I'm on run 50 it's been a long day
oh sorry I got the grades back I just needed to refresh uh all right let's name let's
name let's name ourselves [Music]
Nick what is Nick's rival what is Nick hates
[Music] black belt let's go I think we go I think we go left here sneaky left I'm
feeling like a Magmar kilia is not bad kill is actually dog [ __ ]
bad okay a lantern that would have been way better lunos maybe we go against
something not so bad we have psycho boosts that's amazing no we have psycho boost this could
work this could this could very much work it's CLIA not C
cilia
nah chat what do you think is it cilia or
cilia see
greatest [Music]
JJ oh just
fits oh we could win this you're telling me we're up against
the numl N we could win
this and we have a fluffy tail oh this is Juicy this is a great
start please don't win I'm all in [ __ ] I'm going to try my best hold up hold up let's consider for a moment what psycho
boost does it sharply reduces the user's attack stat so I think we need to use
extra
sensory fire blast is really bad we probably lose now that
sucks [ __ ] that is so sick that the [ __ ] numl had [ __ ] fire [ __ ]
[ __ ]
[Music] blast
[Music] Jesus what's Jesus's rival [Music]
Judas Judas was not his enemy forgave him on the
cross probably be like a burger that [ __ ] would run through
[Music]
them yeah maybe a Zin would be more accurate I couldn't imagine Jesus taking
us in all right I think we go for Jesus we
go
middle oh man oh man Oh Me Oh My this is really
bad wait this actually really
good I just realized I I get to I play play the person my no this is
great I think this is good for me probably maybe am I delusional am I
delulu all right congratulations
plasmatics PL
matics I think we could beat a jump Pluff our moves oh this is one of the
greatest move sets we have ever had oh my God look at this move set so
first off mild nature which means less defense more special attack so our special attack is pretty juicy we have
stench which is pretty decent for this purpose meah horn pedal dance Thunder
Punch rolling kick okay pretty interesting pretty interesting there all
right take the item tm28 what's that what's that you wonder Aurora
beam Aurora beam that's pretty
good I think we teach it he can't learn it never mind I was thinking we don't teach it to be honest must we keep
it uh all right we could also give him a dragon Fang which would do literally nothing
but it's kind of cool it'd be like one of those people who had those shark tooth necklaces in high
school all right we're going up against a jump Pluff there's an obvious answer it is Thunder
Punch you have earthquake even it's a
I don't know why I build up my hope I don't even want to be around anymore dude this is so stupid I don't
even know what I'm doing man I shouldn't even be doing this bro I don't want to be around
anymore freaking
[Music]
another Dragon Fang what are the odds
okay time for sleep bro it's 12:07 I have to I have a meeting at 10:00
tomorrow so I want to go to bed at like 2:00 so I can wake up for my meeting
without too much ladge before going live
again okay let's do it we're going left I feel very good
about it
oh now legendaries are illegal so I can look and I see there's
a Zubat and I see there's a m while so I can't get the legendary but I can
get the M while going into a Zubat I'm allowed to
pick that so it's not the god situation but it's actually pretty good
considering we're we're we got a steel going into a poison type
[Music] love to see the Pokemon L this the one
for real thank you very much o for Crest for the $5 nah seriously though can we get a
twitch Prime for the M while real [ __ ] thank you very much to our sub and
Champion atomize [Music]
atomize wait did we just pay out early
[Music]
oh late
oh all right we have water pulse and magical
Leaf we can probably win with just straight up magical Leaf alone no or sorry not magical Leaf but water
pulse conversion to
that could be
interesting okay we got this [ __ ] Bro than you Mum milk for the 15 months we got this [ __ ] Bro there's no way I lose to this oh my
God and it's Sandstorm and I'm Steel type pulse it rolling kick what the
[ __ ] what's my wind con conversion 2 I just
lose [ __ ] [ __ ]
man [ __ ] dude it's so hard to get a run off the ground in this bro
that's like such a God Spot to even be in I got a Steel type against a poison type and it doesn't even [ __ ] matter
stupid ass trap inch stupid ass I don't even know who you are you don't even look like a Pokemon you look like a neopet full art
execute
wow in Japanese it's kmaa tea oh yeah tmaa cuz t no Tama
cuz Tama go as egg Tama Tama yeah I got there yeah I got there yeah I got
there yeah I'm freaking fluent I guess I don't know maybe it's
stupid I've been trying to learn Japanese a bit more in anticipation of the motorcycle trip I want to
do but I stopped doing my lessons with my Japanese teacher uh cuz it's just really hard I
was missing twice as many as I was going to because of just scheduling conflicts
so now to like work on speaking I've been using chat
GPT but I don't know if I'm comfortable with
it basically there's like the talk feature they released with chat GPT and so I'm
talking to my thing right and it'll talk back to you so I'm
in the car I'm driving I'm like yo tell me a phrase in Japanese and then I'm going to guess what it means
but the the way the AI set up is a little too nice for
me it and it comes off a bit passive aggressive so and it knows Japanese
really really well so I'll be like can you give me a Japanese phrase and I'll guess what it
is and it'll give me a random phrase right and maybe the first one's like watashiwa Jeff and I'll be like oh come on make it a little harder I'll be like
okay it seems like you want a challenge and I'm like a A can you say it slower
and he's like it sounds like you need me to slow it down and I that [ __ ] tilts me every
time and I'm like yep slow it down and then when he slows it down he doesn't
even really slow it down to be honest he's still going pretty very It's like got and then and then I'll say it back
and he is so nitpicky I'll be like [ __ ] masika and he be like
he'll be like wow that was very good it wasn't exactly right though I think you
said Nani gasa and what you wanted to say was Nani
Kasa what you said is why doesn't the fish jerk itself off what you meant to
say is what do you been doing
[Music] it's the best Pokemon in the
game it's literally the best Pokemon in the entire
game septile just out of
[Laughter]
curiosity oh that's so great man
[Music]
oh come on baby roll it visual Warrior thing of the
Prime Taco dude thing of the Prime the Blazing nut thing of the Prime Grog senior welcome to the hot
seat I do think it's a good way to learn I I actually like it a lot it it's a little finicky at
points but you know I just it tilts me can I get can I
not get tilted as a man all right let's take a look you have
tm50 what is that oh you're whoa what are these moves
bro you have Blaze what the [ __ ] are you doing with blaze
bro what do you mean Fury attack bro Parish song twin needle
okay we better we better [ __ ] pray to God that we have a good TM
here tickle the foe is made to laugh reducing
its attack and
defense this is a joke
dude it's fine it's a Ralts Ral is psychic we should win with twin needle
it's
[Music]
bug cashew milk thank you for the three months all right it's a W for salamance
now here here's the issue salamance is a bit hard to level up as
it were and the move set is again [Music]
atrocious oh that's an yes absolutely we pivot
yes yeah we 100% pivot to Metagross Metagross is as strong as salaman and I
think a better typing probably [Music]
actually I'm not sure about that 3% catch rate n no no no the the catch rate has made slightly easier in
this well actually a good amount easier because otherwise it'd be
impossible scope out the move set I can tell you right now A sandstream Metagross is way better than
what I got you died a fairy this is before they they
[ __ ] they they they this is before Dei hit Pokemon okay before they they
turned Pokemon into fairies
okay are you guys on alt-right Pokemon Tik Tok or is it just me
[Music]
level six oh yeah we catch you big [Music]
boy sacred fire oh yeah we catch you big [Music]
boy sacred fire Metagross with sandstream this is great Chad who wants to be Metagross
[Music]
I do me me may may may
I do not pick people for donations but I appreciate the donos
shester shester or is it yes Sun Chester I don't
know what I'm saying it wrong Sun
Chester just enough characters all right let's take a look at what we got so the salamance is great
obviously like in its Max capabilities this certain salamance is just a little bit weaker so that's why we swapped off
uh but I think the Metagross is going to be pretty comparable [Music] oh okay the stats are phenomenal I'm
looking at the stats speed is a concern of mine but good attack good special
attack great defense it's a tank the move sets bro the move sets O
Okay so Moonlight really good uh sacred fire is
good but it's only 5 PP and we don't get another move until
Level
[Music] 20 so this is a bit uh throw and tickle
it's not really like the game changer that you think it is oh no an's not good
enough another slow Pokemon who can't run from Battle [ __ ] me it's my
nightmare bro I mean this is proving his tankiness though like look at me just [ __ ] eat
this
[ __ ] like I that as might kill this guy from my Sandstorm nah he's healing off
man I am sick and tired of slow Pokemon one ember in your toast I don't
even think I I think I take an ember an ember for sure I take an
ember all right I think we killed the Mantine for
now not even that slow yeah I guess I'm not that slow just comparable to man though
all right let's just kill you let's just kill
you so I use nightmare yeah oh wait does nightmare not wait
what why didn't that work nightmare oh a sleeping
foam [ __ ] so I don't even think I can kill this guy cuz I only have sacred fire
oh yeah oh [ __ ] we went burn for burn I think I oh [ __ ] he hit me with a
critical okay hold up I think I
live
Moonlight catch it nah
[Music]
sand stream moonlight so bad oh yeah is I didn't even think about how sand was
weather all right Lantern we might pivot here it's funny
to go from salamance to Metagross to Godlike Pokemon and think this isn't good enough but it really just
isn't don't pivot I might wait to Pivot until after vidiian but
I'm a little concerned about oh [ __ ] hold up we're going to
throw a Pokeball catch and
release I'm not worried about a level three
[Music]
Lantern's got some go to moves yeah the Lantern's pretty
strong gam on first gym yeah we can put up like a 5 minute does lo we be the first
gym what else is in this damn Bush luster Purge Fire
Punch it's an interesting kit for sure man I really don't like not being able
to [Music] run a Paris that is
not oh wow we catch this
100% slacking is so good in a randomizer because it doesn't have the uh the
ability that it normally has that stops it from uh yeah
truant should I try to get a level eight nah n n it's too
greedy I'm happy to just get a level
six all right what do you want to call
it Chad what do you want to call it
T you think it's twitch prime time I think it's twitch Prime Time yo
chat we are still live 12:30 somehow 18,000 people are still watching it's
quite late I'm sure some of you are staying up later than you should be if you haven't do do me a favor double check chat is real quick just let me
know just see by clicking the Subscribe button scrolling down check in and see
if it says subscribe free if you have a twitch Prime mine comes up in 5 days okay if it if it's available you don't
have to use it on me I don't mind okay I'll tell you you can use it on super
TF broxa bunch of streamers are Al right now that I like that you could use it on or whoever you like that you might think
deserve it more right but just make make sure to use it and if it isn't available
know your Prime day okay it's a bit corny whatever but if you like watching
twitch streamers it helps the twitch streamers a lot and uh what the hell is my ability
uh it helps twitch streamers a lot and uh and yeah that's basically it that's my Spiel that's my Spiel anyway I would
use mine on super but I can't let me say hi to him
hi Leos could do this in one shot types with one finger you deserve to suffer
suffer as I have says ratra from
OverWatch speaking of which what you want me to go back is that what you're asking me to do here bro why is Bagel
just like drifting off the [ __ ] map he's bagging he's a Shameless bagger
dog like have some
shame if any he's probably busy he probably has a
lot going on in on his play thank you for the sub Party Pete appreciate
that all right y'all want to see uh the move set for slacking I'm I'm not going to lie I think it's dis disgusting I
think it's I think I think we have ourselves a [ __ ] hero thank you meth for the
prime docile
nature okay okay that is one of the worst abilities you could have but for
slacking specifically it's actually not that bad it's actually not that bad because
not having an ability is better than having an ability with
slacking flamethrower sand attack which is
actually pretty decent disable which is pretty bad but it's replaceable an ancient power which is really good and
look at our attack we have 30 attack at this point in the game 30 attack is
insane thank you Waldo Warrior for the five gifted uh and Genie OS thank you for the five gifted Genie you gifted a
lot today I appreciate it very much thank you for the gifted [Music] guys 30 without a physical move no no no
ancient power is a physical move you don't know how gen 3 works it's okay you're you're young you just didn't you
didn't play this game I don't judge you
this game came out when you were like
two uh I think Luda colo's an instant kill to get its
power and level up I don't even think we consider what else is around here is this a luta Cola with Trent that is so
sad he took what I gave up
yeah that's just a lot of XP dizzy punch
absolutely I would love it you're talking about a stab normal
type move with 100% accuracy that might leave them confused yes thank you
yes slacking is illegal no it's not do you know how I know it's not the
guy who invented iron mons is in my chat and just said win the game with his
character that's how I know it's not illegal now if you have something better
to to refute that I'm all [Music]
ears I got the guy I don't know what to tell you I have
the oh maybe I should have leveled up on this guy I should have looked around
I think slacking is way better than Tyranitar I think tanatar is actually one of it's probably the single
worst 600 base stat Pokemon for this
challenge you you you lose to one like [ __ ] brick break you can't be Forex week Forex week
is so brutal oh the Pokemon's slacking Phil
Twisted [Music]
Spoon okay let's think for a moment I would like to swap for
convenience sake dizzy punch into the first
position man menuing used to be so dog [ __ ] gen five is so
good okay all right we're good first fight this is this is where a lot of runs end
this fight right here I I had a a trainer that had a Lugia and a
lattos Cay doll that's chill that's chill we just rip a dizzy
punch don't even think about it
this [ __ ] lowkey
tanky [ __ ] me [ __ ]
Ooka gu's tanky as [ __ ] flamethrower flamethrower wouldn't be
good one explosion and it's over it's a randomizer little pup what's up baby he
could have a fighting move do you think I should potion or is it a little bit oh I didn't pick up the
potion all right [ __ ] it we ball n why am I nervous I forgot how
tanky I am I got scared because of how thick the clay doll was let me go grab the potion that was silly that I didn't
grab it potions are so vital did I fight somebody in the bottom
territory chat oh yeah Metagross I caught I didn't fight but I caught both Pokemons had rough skin I
know it's crazy so yeah it's a randomizer everything's randomized abilities are randomized uh everything except for
types are randomized so like abilities moves Natures what it evolves into so if
you see a Cay doll you don't have to be like oh no
explosion to be honest any Pokemon could have EXP expion and then you're [ __ ] yeah stats
are also randomized yeah base yeah sorry the base stats aren't randomized so the same stats will be allotted or the same
number of stats but where those stats go is randomized yeah
100% so you have to kind of rewrite your your Chemistry so like you know this Caterpie could have explosion it would
be crazy it would suck but [Music] whatever it still has dog sh B stats
though so we kill it why why does everyone have rough skin what is this the [ __ ] rough skin Forest what are we doing here come on
man I think I rock ancient power yeah for sure ancient
power you got milk
[Music] drink flamethrower flamethrower is kind of mid
cuz um I'm just going to dizzy punch flamethrower is kind of mid because uh it's a special move cuz in gen 3 they
didn't figure out that different typings should have the ability to do physical and special so they just made entire
types physical or special so all fire moves are special I think this is a
pretty clearcut dizzy punch Watashi nion
gindes uh watashiwa America gindes yosko and
aim overlays cool thank you it was all done by
utto and implemented by Tim
does he even understand stab do you understand stab is 1.5x and super effective is 2x what are you even talking
about when you open your mouth you expect people to not listen and that's why you spread misinformation I'm just
[Music]
curious yeah we shouldn't be in the fire Le re uh Tim we're in the wrong category by the
way we should uh be in The Scarlet Violet category isn't that standard
right real Pokemon heads no you're supposed to be in the newest Pokemon
[Music] category colon
zero no brother you've never streamed why are you piping up right
now this ain't a football game okay this is not like when you tell Patrick Mahomes he shouldn't have thrown it I
read what you say and I'm a [ __ ] Master at what I do I will say
[Music]
that Master o the okay relative to anything I've ever
tried in my life I'm the best at this rock ground dizzy punch
[Music]
[ __ ] share your Super Bowl prop bet it's [ __ ] rigged bro it's just
going to be the the Chiefs like there's just nothing we can do about it what's a fun Propet
[Music]
though I don't know why I did that I was a [Music] mistake kill yourself kill yourself kill
yourself kill yourself kill yourself [ __ ] no I'm going to kill myself
okay lowkey I think I need to use a
potion cuz if he uses water pulse and I hit myself with confusion i' lose the
[Music] game sand attack that's not how it works
I would still hit myself with [Music] confusion just factually if I were
If he if he Dodges confusion he successfully hits me with water pulse or digs either one and I hit myself in
confusion on my turn I'm going to do enough damage that when he hits me I
die it's just not worth the risk why is it even a question use the potion cuz potions are so
rare [ __ ] me dude I snapped out of confusion and it didn't end up
mattering it's all right I'd rather be safe than sorry folks I'd rather be safe
than [Music] sorry thank you froggy for the 300 bits
thank you kitun way for the 500 bits Underdog thank you the prime Bean King
Aiden thank you the 25 mon bonga thank you the prime should have trusted nah that's
hindsight that's not [ __ ] Works in life bro that's like that you're like one of
those people who plays poker and you fold 27 and then someone else had like Ace King and then the board is like 222
and you're like dude if I didn't fold I would have
[Music]
quads yeah and if you invested in Nvidia 10 years ago you'd be like [ __ ] 30X richer you didn't do it though you
[Music]
know skull
Bash that's interesting I don't know about that one though
better than sand attack here's the thing I actually don't think so I think sand attack's [Music]
better sand attack can win around I don't understand a
scenario where skull bash wins you around like What scenario would you rather use one skull bash than two dizzy
punches two dizzy punches is more
powerful out of PP yeah I guess like that's the only
scenario raising defense sets you up against a team full of physical attackers but there's never a team full of physical attackers cuz all moves are
randomized so even if somebody has a like a and all all stats are randomized
so you don't know what you're walk you can't you can't ever know
even the most conventionally physical attacker Pokemons could have like fire
beam Leaf blade ice beam and it doesn't matter
[Music]
anymore I'm keeping it 100 with you I'm going to take a [ __ ] after this
[Music] you miss an item Southeast n you're
lying are you
playing this one I got this [Music]
one oh momu milk that's huge thanks chat uh actually I was okay with walk
down anyway because uh I would like to fight my rival to uh train up before Brock's gym
cuz it's the last trainer that you can possibly fight before attempting Brock's
gym and we're going for maximum
XP I want to suck every last drop from you [Music] game I don't know why I said that I'm
sorry that was inappropriate [Music]
don't say that while talking to a nurse don't make it a thing I wasn't
doing I wasn't doing it like that don't you're making it weird on my behest all right deep seek hey open AI
you're about off to the Pokemon Leaf forget about it you probably don't even have poke badges do you the guard won't
let you through without them by by the way did your Pokemon get
stronger all right he's got a level 14 xan Goose we hit that [ __ ] with a dizzy
[Music] punch swave it missed guess what second
dizzy punch that's good XP that's good
XP what you got in the back your Ralts your dog [ __ ] ass Ralts peace
stop talking to me [ __ ] yeah dude okay I'm feeling very powerful
headed to the first [Music] gym I think chat I think we
might beat the first gym leader today which I'm pretty sure is like the
hardest milestone in the irmon until you hit like end game
[Music]
it's top three I'm assuming it's Elite 4
One beating Brock well getting past Brock two what's
three what's what's what's harder than that
the lab oh I was considering this part of the lab I guess but yeah I see what you're
saying all right y'all ready y'all ready to freak
[Music]
G [Music]
people people
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
wait I'm sorry I left the call and Atri and S are still hanging
out we could upload that to a separate YouTube channel just say goodbye and then keep hanging out
did someone just [ __ ] The Vibes up or something was like w we all leaving type
[ __ ] no we were we were yeah yeah you're like I gotta okay all right all right everybody lat see
you later y all right [Music]
later Ser we could not have laid it on more that is that's crazy
yeah we we can plan that we'll do like you know what I know that actually out of to pretty soon
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh no [Music]
that
clip all right we ready let's do this [ __ ] first
gy is about to be in the books
[Music] what I hate to see fighting
types blissy blissy blissy blissy Blissey is not too
fearsome psycho boost that's scary but it's going to hurt
them wow that did a lot okay
[Music] I did a lot drill pick okay we're still fine
here that might level us up Bliss he gives a lot of XP there we [Music]
go all right what do you got in the back something Spearow that's a one shot if I had seen it maybe would have gone for
the ancient power but doesn't matter poison Point that's fine we are
not playing Kaiser rules so I'm not forced to stay here I go to the Pokemon [Music]
Center now this is officially the farthest to run has ever gotten yeah
[Music]
[Music]
all right let's go come on Brock we got this
[ __ ] so you're here I'm Brock I'm rock hard all my Pokemon are rock
hard cuz it's all my my Pokemon are rock
hard your name's Wayne
furet don't think about it dizzy punch
glammo poison gas it misses God bless so we hit him with the
blammo might be enough to level us up probably not close though he always got
one more Pokemon level 20 one furet hit him with the
glammo ingrain what's that going to do heal you for maybe 7 HP it might mean that it's going to take
me two more hits of dizzy punch to kill not even goodbye see you later this is [ __ ] easy man
[ __ ] yeah dude [ __ ] yeah man and to my
Believers this was for [Music]
you first gym down seven more to go I'm not even going to
lie I am a firm believer in this [ __ ] slack
King he is big swizzy swizzy do tricks on
it TM 39 okay what is the
TM twin
needle it's not the worst move [Music]
honestly but I don't think I can learn it I'm almost positive oh I
can but I don't really need a counter for psychic types it's not really necessary it's not good coverage really
no like when am I ever using twin needle ever think about it twin needle does 50
damage even if it's super effective it does 100 but my dizzy punch does 70 stab
105 so dizzy punch is stronger and can cause
confusion so in What scenario am I ever using
it it's not against psychic it's not against dark it's not against
[Music] Grass I think ghost is an argument
[Music] but it's not super effective against ghosts is it
[Music]
it's not very effective against Ghosts no it's not even good again no it's there's I don't think there's a single scenario where this is
usable the only scenario is if I am out of
pp I I think [Music]
if I want to move to add coverage I'm trying to cover against
like what a ghost type really that's it and even then ancient power kind of
gets the job [Music]
done I think if I could add one move to my rep it would probably be a ghost
move like Shadow Ball I think Shadow Ball would be
good or like a like a earthquake of course earthquake would be
good yeah flamethrower I mean flamethrower probably needs to
what I I I want a fighting move in place of flamethrower I'm going to keep flamethrower in case a Steel type comes
up because if a Steel type comes up and I don't have it I think I'm more [ __ ] than if I had twin
[Music] needle cuz like my special attack it's
actually kind of falling off man my attack is high high
e heal I I healed oh no I didn't
[Music] heal
smog all right I'm going to go oh no hold up hold up hold up hold up hold up
hold up oh he killed himself uhoh uhoh
I am Frozen against a Gerra this is my
nightmare oh
[ __ ] and we back
all right scary scary but we get through
it it wasn't that close to be honest cuz we still had a moomoo
milk that's why keep flamethrower I'm with you I'm team keep flamethrower
now A Move Like earthquake is like a bar for bar better move like it
just
inarguably we get a new move right here level 19 we get a new move
right come on man Baton Pass you can't come up with a worse move
than that [Music]
all right time is it okay we're going to keep
going uh I would like to save so my game doesn't crash I'm scared though
lowkey okay I just to a safe state for now skip bloom
[Music] swub
um okay we can do one more fight and then we need to go back for more
PP this is like the best part of the game cuz I'm kind of just [ __ ]
printing XP and I One Shot everything like I'm just going to be overleveled for a while
[Music]
all right we kill Mankey thank you Bros for life for the oneye angle misspelled thank you very much for the prime I
appreciate it thanks for all the subs guys we uh we gained 2,000 subs today I was at
18K when the stream started today we got 18K Subs that's
crazy so I appreciate it very much oh God that was
scary it's a lot that's what I'm saying dude I'm recognizing how hard a kaiso
iron Manon is that's his bananas
is there a level cap no there is no level
cap my man yeah sorry I suppose there is a
level cap it's level 100 that's correct s you think of the 35 months
oh Mia try attack that's not too scary
[Music] damn I'm a big
[Music] [ __ ] wait did I just skip learning a
new [Music]
move no I learned my next move at [Music]
25 oh
gar I don't think there's a single Pokemon I could even consider
[Music] replacing my guy
with right like I couldn't even consider
[Music] one all I can do is
kill the Gengar and call it a
[Music]
day is there a Rival Battle that I should know
[Music] about I'm going to heal it's a over
zealous heal but not for a while I I uh my knowledge of gen one or I guess Kanto is very
uh [ __ ] I don't play a lot of Kanto
[Music]
18K people at up at 1:00 a.m. is bizarre this is like the Super Bowl man
you're you're for me you're taking one of the worst Pokemon players of all time and having him play one of the hardest
ways to play Pokemon this is my Super Bowl bro 4:00
a.m. here okay so in Ultimate kaiso Iron Manon once you enter
a cave you are not allowed to exit the cave
fortunately we are not playing those rules so I'm allowed to exit whenever I
[Music] want we it's 2 a.m. for me and I'm at
work I look I know you're like trying to hurt me to go me here are the facts the
two people I know who have tried the the kaiso iron modon took multiple months one guy took
a year to do it we're talking multiple thousands of resets hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours I am
trying to do this in one stream I'm not trying to be live for S
months straight cuz I'm also worse at games than everyone who I've seen try
it why are you not trying to be live for months cuz I you know maybe you didn't
know this I actually love my girlfriend and I won't have one at the end of the
stream you gross
okay I would I would lose my I would lose my girlfriend I would lose my friends I would lose my
podcast and all I would have to show for it is an accomplishment that has already been done by not just like a handful of
people but people in my sphere they'd be like oh that's cool
yeah I did that last year that was no that was tough for
sure now look here's the thing right now the game is easy for me
it won't stay this way because all trainers are 50% stronger and that
includes Elite 4 trainers right
and although I can leave right now to go to the Pokemon Center you can't do that in the Elite
4 One counter or destiny Bond and it's over
yeah I know for today I'm only allowing myself
one Pokemon and then tomorrow I'm going to allow myself one more more Pokemon to the
[Music]
party and then the day after I'll do one more Pokemon and then the day after one more
Pokemon that's not even an iron Monon yeah it is you don't know what it
is you don't even know how hard the iron mons were when they came out
[Music]
even the classic rule set you get one Pokemon no that's what I'm
saying there's one Niche rule set that makes you use only one Pokemon and it's called a Ultimate kaiso Iron Manon
that's it that's the only
[Music] one
Amnesia I can't imagine that's the
play for flamethrower I would have lost to Gerra [Music]
better than sand attack I actually don't I'm not convinced on that I could be
[Music]
wrong all right let's give myself a cleanse
tag Su glacer I thought I had a [ __ ] cleanse
tag one more Pokemon makes it boring I I swear to God your brain cells
rubbing together to [ __ ] form words impresses me I'm genuinely happy you can
do it cuz I'm sure when you were born it took longer than than your parents thought it
would do you know what a second Pokemon does do you even
know do you even know what it
does it's not like you get two slacking and you have [ __ ] Shaq and Kobe who are putting up
numbers because you have a limited amount of XP cuz you can only get XP from one Pokemon per round out and then
every trainer that's it so if you spread the XP across two Pokemon you're just weaker as a
squad would you rather have two Al Horford's or one Luca well you know what
actually me give you a better analogy would you rather have two ads or one LCA donic ad might be a bit too strong for
that analogy but point stands the second Pokemon B basically
becomes a ragd doll someone who you throw in to take a hit take a destiny
Bond you [Music] know or heal your carry so your carry can do
stuff so it adds a bit of buffer but it's not like you get a two very very strong Pokemon and then you have the
ability to level them that's just not so realistic
[Music]
what is Destiny Bond it's a move that when your opponent dies kills the person
across them [Music]
yeah yeah Parish songs another example Parish song is more avoidable because five turns is usually long enough that
you can
kill it's three no it's
five it's three m [Music]
nah I'm pretty sure I got you on this one but I guess thanks for
[Music]
commenting I watch a wolf click video on it okay
I watched a video of young Sheldon earlier so like we can both Flex all day
about what we [Music]
consume dude I really thought this cleanse tag would do [ __ ] turns out it don't do [ __ ]
[Music]
[Music]
it it genuinely feels as bad as not having the cleanse tag [Music]
[Music]
GL item [ __ ] City [Music]
baby dizzy punch I should consider using ancient power more just to uh
diversify my PP usage where'd you get your shirt from
William Osman he gave it to [Music] me Max revive that's crucial for
me what if you were cast into a shadow and destroyed what the [ __ ] what are you
talking about
what in the hell is even that what do you mean
[Music] answer I'm not dodging the qu there's nothing to
dodge What If I Were cast into Shadow and destroyed I'd be destroyed I'd be destroyed I would be
destroyed I guess I should ask them what would happen to me I'd be destroyed I
that's it
like I don't think I don't think in this situation I get to be like I would be destroyed but I would actually like you know what I mean like I'm
destroyed they said what H like this like Nick earlier today
pissing me off on the oh [ __ ] Focus that's a ghost
type Nick was pissing me off on the yard today holy [ __ ] that
guy I think he he figured out what hypotheticals are so he kept throwing
out hypotheticals but they
suck you want to hear a real hypothetical he
provided this is the Primo so if you're not a patron you get extra content here
[Music]
I'm trying to think what it was hold up I got to [ __ ] lock in it was so stupid I wiped it from my
memory cuz it pissed me [Music]
off he said Aiden if you were the last human on
earth who could give birth and your gation period was 1
month how many kids would you give birth
to now there's some follow-up questions that come from this yes your children can also give
birth
[Music] you are Immortal in this scenario and you get to choose when you end your
life your children are also Immortal your grandchildren however are not
Immortal but they can give birth and here's the real kicker when you decide
to end your life every Offspring you've ever had also dies
instantly so anyway how many kids would you have
so what's the point exactly exactly exactly
right so the let's just rephrase the question he was asking how long would you play The Sims for until you got
bored cuz that's what the [ __ ] question [Music]
is and you know Aiden [ __ ] Aiden [Music] Aiden takes everything at face value so
Aiden's like um I'd probably do it for like a thousand years i' probably give birth
yeah I think I'd do like a thousand years give birth to like 12,000 kids you know and yeah probably move to Sweden me
and the 12,000 kids and the grandkids I'd give them maybe Finland or or Norway
and and then I'd probably call it quits there [ __ ] off the both of them
[Music]
it'd be selfish to call [Music]
quits I I would probably [ __ ] go to Nick's house shoot myself in front of him and then write a note that said Nick
did it for revenge for him putting me in that scenario
damn we got bangers tonight this is from Pokemon this the bicycle theme from X
and Y how did such a horrible game produce such a great
theme stop I found these fossils they're mine fing
[Music] B X and Y was fine it was not it was the downfall Pokémon it's when they went
from beautiful Sprite 2D to
3D Chad Domer
Helix Helix all right let's from me a [Music]
helix amulet
coin god damn it I wish I had a real [ __ ] cleanse tag why do they even make the cleanse
tag this looks easy I'm on R50 dude it's day one and I in in 9 hours I just got
past the first gym get a
[Music] grip uh you know you're supposed to be
able to run to get items here but I'm not going to do it because I'm
sick nugget all right let's check our bag cuz we actually got a lot of [ __ ] upgrade
red flute two firestones Twisted Spoon Mumu milk Pearl guard spec Max repel
dire hit blue flut fluffy tail Sunstone HP up
Moonstone LAX incense Mystic
water LAX incense could be interesting no [Music]
reducing the fo's accuracy is kind of [Music]
sick and then we have a heart scale and an amulet coin I don't think an amulet
coin really matters in this situation it's 5% isn't 5% in Pokemon
massive I mean it's better than a cleanse tag so I'm going to wear it
TMS we have mimic twin needle slash that's Splash and tickle Berry
pouch we got an aspir Berry and a lumber a lumber is pretty
good as a hold item if we're in a more tense position
[Music]
reflect air [Music]
cutter air cutter is pretty interesting let's think of a scenario
where we would like air cutter so air cutter is super effective
against Grass oh honestly
fighting bug still weak to steal though it's really
just fighting types to kill them quicker it's probably better than the
sand attack I think we still have our same hole against
um silver same hole against steel types
uh actually I don't know if I feel as confident anymore it's only 55
damage yeah I actually don't think we do it 55 damage with 95%
accuracy it what's the crit rate chat High crit what does that mean though
what does a high crit rate mean one in eight
okay I mean cool so one in eight times it's going to
crit like [ __ ] one in eight times it's going to
miss I
think interesting
I don't know if it's the
call new rocks thank
[Music]
you I think it's PP is very valuable
[Music] it's just kind of important in Long
sequences especially if we I mean if we get so lucky to go all the way to the Elite 4 to be able to have that much PP
is kind of crucial all right let's is this a new
route actually or is this the same route from before the uh oh this is a new encounter it says
[Music]
lotad blood focus on the pp
okay I think my dream move is return [Music]
I would take stomp earthquake would be
sick all right I just don't know if I really care about that clamp [Music]
Pearl Cerulean City okay there's a Rival Battle in this city I'm pretty sure it's
when you head north to the bridge
[Music]
if you get enough money you can't actually get it right chat [Music]
it's one above the money cap that's so [Music]
cringe do I just fight the Rival call to [Music]
day [ __ ] it let's go
[Music]
all
right he's probably going to start with a his zangus clay
doll level 26 [Music]
let's go dizzy punch he's got rough skin he's got
stomp okay one down three to
[Music] go what
ancient power destroys forx weak it's
going to do 240 base now it's a one shot and that's good XP
and we get the buff from the ancient power which gives plus one to all of our
stats and [Music]
okay Beldum steel psychic it's a flamethrower angle you do have plus one
special attack right now he goes for ice punch does nothing yeah I should have equipped the
oneberry here you're right I just thought the fight wouldn't be too big of a deal and to be honest I
don't think it is but final Pokemon did he get rid of his
Ralts wait what oh they randomly evolve
what did it evolve into oh into this flaffy right it must just be this
[Music] fluffy can you
evolve no it must be what did it evolve into no it must have
been balum I didn't think you could evolve into the same tier
like I thought you had to evolve
up it's base stats based so Beldum has higher base stats than ralt so it's
fine I guess makes
sense all right see you later deep seek oh what the hell oh yeah right I feel
sorry for you now you're always plotting behind me so I'll give you this as a f Fame Checker
what the hell is that what is the f I don't even know
what this [Music]
is
what what does this
do does it just pull up the dialogue options of people you've
seen I couldn't come up with something more useless if I
[Music]
tried all right we are good we are now back to grind
session was this guy's name Marilyn Monroe did I read that [Music]
[Music] right manager Maryland oh no I didn't
read it right
damn all all right can we do a Gamba for Misty yeah
if we got a mod Tom Lawns thank you for the prime new rocks thank you very much
[Music] oh heal after every battle I mean we
don't have to heal after every battle we'd be here a little bit too
long
we're going all the way with slacking well let's not [Music]
uh let's not get a little too
cocky wow that sucks that sucks new move spiderweb
all right when do we learn our next move level 36 okay that's
doable all right we beat the trainers on the bike
Road hold on I'm going to grab a water real quick
all
right yeah it's canned is it okay if I get a sparkling water sure punch
I received a [Music] nugget and then they offered for me to
join Team Rocket oh I don't have to be doing all
this I have air cutter now sweet PE thank you very much for the
raw tier one
can I play face it with you not today
man Mak Hardy thank you the five man what's
up Hardy I don't think there's any value in
killing these wild Pokemon is there am I being stupid to not kill them like I'm obviously not PIV
[Music] viting it's just not even that much xp
right I mean whatever I guess any XP is good
XP you're allowed to kill one that's just so meaningless I feel like Shadow punch oh no
[Music]
way so let's see the use case it's really just for Ghost types that's pretty much it
right it's only for Ghost
[Music] types H oh I can't learn it never
mind I guess that makes sense a normal type should have be allowed to learn a ghost
[Music] move I think I can get rid of
flamethrowers soon though well that was
[Music] scary
look how long as this game it it's the standard H gyms po Elite 4 you have to
beat the enemy team before doing the Elite
4 I would say like eight hours like a successful run maybe
[Music] longer scope lens could be clutch wait
why would that even matter for me doesn't that just increase accuracy
oh critical hit ratio oh I was not thinking of the right
[Music] item what is the increase 5% or something
[Music] L why is this guy avoiding my eye
contact [Music]
[Music] are there double battles in this game I assume there are
right that would be really [ __ ] horrible if I did I have to avoid double battles like the plague
you need an HM you don't need cut to beat the game do you I guess you need every hm at the
end right I'm allowed to keep an HM buddy
[Music]
around why is slacking not skipping turn because he don't have uh truant as his
ability he has plus and plus is an ability which is actually really cool it makes you
stronger if you're playing with minim
so that's good I
[Music]
guess you can't even get into a battle a double battle with a single Pokemon that's good to know
[Music]
Harden I don't think that'll help me Hyper potion that's
[Music]
huge minus as your hm buddy I don't even know how strong the
ability is like how much stronger do you really get
are you allowed to use revives no but I Al I only have one Pokemon so
there's nothing to If I Die there's no one to revive me 50% special attack oh that's so ass
for me [Music]
am I allow to have more than one Pokemon not today but I I'm thinking of expanding it tomorrow if this run
fails so I'm going to keep this run solo for however long it goes but if it fails
which chances are it will then tomorrow I would allow myself two
Pokemon
what what do I do [Music]
oh hey what's up Bill thanks for the ticket
bill when this run fails I'm look I'm with you I think there's a high chance this run
fails but you know what I think it's good to think like that cuz then it'll keep me more on my
toes damn y'all's house is a mess wait
what they stole a TM for teaching Fire Punch though I would love that
[Music] TM there's so many trainers in this area it's insane oh new move new move new
move come on oh I thought I got a new move maybe it's 36
oh I keep both I kept a 99 I received
[Music] tm28 oh it is fire punch oh will we just
replace flamethrower for sure no we don't why the [ __ ] would I do
that I didn't realize flamethrower power was that high
is it time do I take on the
gym I should be strong [Music] enough I think it's in my
interest cut the music let's rock the game music
here I think I should Rock a lumber for
Misty Lumber so valuable that's why I'm not using it against the trainers cuz I would hate if I just got like stun sport
and then wasted [Music]
it I also don't know her levels she might be a bit
weak her Ace is 36 if her if she got a level 36 I I
definitely switch to Lumber yeah I think it'd be a bit foolish and
ghoulish not to cuz she could have a
freeze Unk the same age as her Ace yeah
y does the guy at the door give bottled water in this game
nah but he does
Nar all right we got a [Music] lumber and a Heart full of
gold wait Misty
the hair I like
it see that was the Misty fit I was going to wear today I just couldn't find it in
time fee ass hit him with a dizzy
punch Feebas a very weak Pokemon base stats 200 we're not too sad about this
Pokemon number two could be stressful dong Water Ice not a Pokemon we would
like to use flamethrower against however ancient
power is going to be super
effective and we're [Music] done we're
done easy now if anyone's wondering there is
no level cap because the game will scale to a point where where uh it doesn't
matter as much so this might feel like it's easy but we are at the easy part of the
game Rock blast if it had higher accuracy would' be one of the best moves in the
game but it has horrible accuracy a 100% accuracy Rock blast
would go crazy bro it still gets mogged by earthquake
but I guess that's just I'm literally just that's just magnitude magnitude is just rock blast
with 100%
[Music] accuracy oh we got a TM for Misty yeah
let's check what it
is did she give me camouflage nah no way she gave me
camouflage that sucks R tm's banned
Nar boom boom boom boom boom learn
Shadow punch slacking can't learn Shadow punch take the lumber off thank you cuz
that's a good call we'll swap it for the scope LS
again if you don't want to look 30 talking about Pokemon don't compare magnitude and rock
blast thanks man I appreciate the advice
and if it helps tomorrow it's yal MX plus
b plus b it's important
[Music]
matang damn it's my
girl all right let's just kill him for 400 XP
I don't think we need to go to the
daycare hi do you have a nitan I'll trade it for my quill lava not a bad
trade but I don't have
[Music] either damn
it can we get the music back yeah actually no we're fine I just run
we don't need to speed up right now I'll just use a
[Music] [ __ ] there's no Pokemon down here
what oh didn't know that there are items for days down here
though sheesh PP Max is
fire PP up is [Music]
fire those are both two big W's we just
received probably the single worst usage of a Repel
great
ball let's fight why am I streaming is 4:00 a.m. CU I got to I got to beat Pokemon Bro
[Music] you didn't [Music]
die catch it it's um not possible to catch unfortunately
cuz it's one against the rules and two to a trainer's [Music]
[Music]
Pokemon and three it's dead
[Music] true oh I learned my next move at level 30 7 that's quite
convenience hit yourself hit yourself
goat my man would you [ __ ] a Vaporeon if it was if
it was giving you the love eyes oh new a
ingrain maybe that's not actually bad
[Music]
how much is the [Music]
healing like I'm imagining 116th of your
[Music] health is that the same as the leftovers
I guess I'm just imagining like I'm in the Elite 4 and I'm using [Music]
this for like five extra Pokemon on the first Pokemon
[Music]
I think we'll pass Flareon think of the ra tier one
[Music] Joe pathetic thank you for the three
months hey your boyfriend sucked Tower you now the sad news is we only get to
learn one more move now I think our move set's actually somewhat decent it would be improved vastly with an
earthquake maybe like a [Music]
slam maybe a protect
return would be good too [Music]
yeah try attack would be good yeah there's a few things I would
prefer
are you just not going to sleep tonight I mean it's only two I'll probably go to bed in the next half hour maybe after
SSN
all right oh my God it's Plusle my
friend what I mean the analogy is just the
straightup trade would you rather have lucaon chich or Anthony Davis and Max
Christy l
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] I just looked up at a [ __ ]
reichu [Music]
raiku all right we just go with Dizzy punch
L do you have a favorite NFL team if not can I interest you in the Los Angeles
Chargers made it to the playoffs on a rebuild year with only one good receiver
only up from here love the stream smile I like the dog [ __ ] Patriots give
me five wins
give me five wins a damn season I'm happy give me one close game against the
Buffalo Bills and like a two and four record in
my Division I have super difficult
challenge play Wolfenstein old blood Wolfenstein the New Order and
Wolfenstein 2 the New Colossus all on main labor difficulty which is the
hardest and just complete all three games with main there are no
checkpoints guy who just be Wolfenstein trying to get people to play Wolfenstein all right chat we'll end it
here we'll end it here so here's the deal guys the stream is not
ending however I am going to bed and here's what happens at
bedtime Twitch Plays Pokemon
begins so what I mean by this is that you
guys I'm scared of hitting save on anything here to be
honest all I did was save save the state I'll call it a day
there should we give them a randomized or a vanilla Twitch Plays
Pokemon what do you guys want would you guys prefer randomized or
vanilla vanilla is much easier I think randomize you could get [ __ ] I
think Chad really wants randomized so let's give him randomized
I I would think vanilla is easier and your goal should be to try to beat me because that's when you get the Thousand
gifted but I could be wrong I mean I guess in the same way random like the
the thing about vanilla is you know everything that's coming up if it's
randomized you don't but you could also randomize and then your starter could be
a legendary or you could randomize and find a legendary in the [ __ ] you know Highway and catch it or some [ __ ] like
that you know I'll pull it I'll pull
it isn't vanilla too easy uh I mean thousands of people are
playing and like hundreds of people are going to be putting in different inputs so I would I would think no I don't
think it's easy like I don't know what the world record is fastest Twitch Plays Pokemon I
don't know what the fastest time to beat Twitch Plays Pokemon
is I'm assuming it was pretty
fast the very first one took 16
days all right chat PLL is up please vote I like to think of myself as
having rando's easier I could be
easier look if it goes to [ __ ] tonight we can change it tomorrow
all right chat so here's the deal you guys are playing Twitch Plays
Pokemon uh Tim I'll let you set all that up you guys are be playing Twitch Plays
Pokemon uh and it's going to be chaotic which is not like an expression
I'm using to describe your experience but it just means that it'll take
whatever the first available input is when an input is ready to be used Anarchy that's the
word um and good luck good luck your goal is
to beat Pokemon before I do okay and if you do stream ends and
you get a thousand Subs all right that's the deal so let me put it in
um Can a mod make a exclamation point
exclamation point
allegations no can we do an exclamation point chat plays Pokemon exclamation
point it can't be rules because we already have rules I think
exclamation point how to with a small explainer on Twitch Plays Pokemon and
then also the reward of 1,000
gifted we can do TPP that's cool meet Tim I TPP yeah just explaining how it works
and then also the Thousand gifted if they beat me
all right sleep is the category just called
Sleep what is it called just
sleeping just sleeping I'm Only Sleeping why do they always have to have the weird weirdest [ __ ]
names all right I uh I'll show you my bed when I come back Tim I don't you
need to hop on I'm going to uh brush my teeth and [ __ ] and I'll be back here in
a bit and I'll show you my bed and then uh
and then yeah I'll be up at like 10: and I'll be back at like 11: cuz have a
meeting at 10: so that's my
plan
